KHAN the auditor and head of computing department of a bank here in london,UnitedKingdom.There is an account opened in this bank in 1995 and since my inception into office in 2000, nobody has operated on this account again, after going through some old files, I discovered that if I do not remit this money out urgently, it will be forfeited for nothing. In order to transfer out fifteen-million pounds sterling) from our bank here have the courage to look for a reliable and honest person who will be capable for this important transaction, believing that you will never let me down either now or in future.

I know that this message will come to you as a surprise as we don't know our selves before neither have we let, but be sure that it is real and a genuine business.   I believe in God that you will never let me down in this investment. I am contacting you because of the need to involve a foreigner with a foreign account as the real beneficiary. I need your co-operation to make this work fine, because the management is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has the correct information to this account, which I will Give to you when sure of your capability to handle such amount in strict confidence and trust according to my instructions and my advice for our mutual benefit because I don't want to make any mistake, I need your strong assurance and trust.

The $86K Government Affairs Environment charge is from Susan Warthan c/c 100222. Also the $27K for Environmental Policy and Compliance is from Jeffery Keeler c/c 100223. To query these please email Susan and Jeffery directly. (These charge outs have been based on anticipated usage).  2. Yes, you are correct about Rick's costs you are being allocated 0.9% of a $23.4M budget, (which I assume is his whole departmental costs). Should Europe's charge-out be based on Rick's or the Exec group's time only? You will need to forward an email to Rick for justification if required.

We are covering Europe for ourselves and don't really see why we should pick up a share of Corp's spend on Kyoto etc. 2.

phishing,legitimate,True,"From Mr Cheung Pui TREAT AS URGENT FROM:MR.CHEUNG PUI Hang Seng Bank Ltd Sai Wan Ho Branch  171 Shaukiwan Road Hong Kong. e-mail address : cheung_pui1@hotmail.ro    Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr.Cheung Pui,director of operations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd,Sai Wan Ho Branch.I have a business proposal for you.  Before the U.S and Iraqi war,our client Major Fadi Basem who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war early this year. Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the Major and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.  After further investigation it was also discovered that Major Fadi Basem did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Twenty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the  laws of my country at the expiration 3 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem so that you will be able to receive his funds.   WHAT IS TO BE DONE:  I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary documents that will back you up as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem,all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the transfer of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.  There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue.Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me,25%for you,and 5% for any expenses incurred during the course of the operation. Should you be interested please send me your full names and current residential address and I will prefer you to reach me on the email address: cheung_pui1@hotmail.ro  Once i get your response to co-operate,i shall provide you with more details of this operation.  Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.  Kind Regards,  Mr.Cheung Pui     _________________________________________________________________",1

phishing,legitimate,True,"YOURS  FAITHFULLY DR.EVERES HENRY AUDDITOR GENERAL  PERSONAL & CONFIDENTIAL  ATTN:  Dear.........,  PROVISION OF BANK ACCOUNT TO DEPOSIT FUNDS""   Please accept my sincere apology if my email does not meet your business or personal ethics. I will first introduce myself as DR.EVERES HENRY, a staff in the audit section of a well-known bank, here in London, England.   One of our accounts, with holding balance of 26,000,000 (Twenty Six Million Pounds Sterling) has been dormant and last operated three years ago. From my investigations and confirmation, the owner of the said account, a foreigner by name John Shumejda died on the 4th of January 2002 in a plane crash in Birmingham; you can view this CNN website: (http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/01/04/england.plane/)for details on the crash. Since then, nobody has done anything as regards the claiming of this money, as he has no family member that has any knowledge as to the existence of either the account or the funds; and also information from the National Immigration also states that he was single on entry into the UK.   After detailed investigations on the deceased and his account, I found out there is no mention of any heirs or family member on the account document in the Bank records, therefore the money was lodged secretly into the account. Plans are to transfer the fund out with your sincerely help. This transaction is totally free of risk and troubles as the fund is legitimate and does not originate from drug, money laundry, terrorism or any other illegal act.  On your interest, let me hear from you URGENTLY. I look forward to hear from you soonest.  May God bless you.  Warm Regards, DR.EVERES HENRY.       __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!? Tired of spam?  Yahoo!

Dear Friend,  I am Mr.Brian Capon the system and control director at the NATIONAL WESTMINISTER BANK.I am writing this letter to solicit for support and assistance from you to carry out this business opportunity in my bank.  Lying in an inactive account is the sum of 11million pounds sterling belonging to a foreign customer(Michael Gambone) who was a gas consultant here in UK,who happens to be deceased during a business trip. He died with his wife(Deborah Gambone) on board the Swissair Flight 111 , which crashed into the Atlantic off Nova Scotia in september 2nd 1998. The news of this crash was on the news which we have notified his relatives to no avail.See links below for more detail information:  http://cnnstudentnews.cnn.com/WORLD/9809/swissair.victims.list/ http://cnnstudentnews.cnn.com/WORLD/americas/9809/08/swissair.02/  Ever since he died the bank has been expecting his next of kin to come and claim these fund. To this effect, we can not release the money unless someone applies for it as next of kin, as indicated in our banking guideline.Unfortunately he has no family member in UK or Over-sea who are aware of the existence of the money(as he was a gas consultant. At this juncture i have decided to do business with you by soliciting your assistance in applying as the next of kin to the bank then the money will be released to you,as I do not want this money to go into the bank treasury as an unclaimed bill,because the banking law and guideline stipulates that if such money(s) remains unclaimed  for a period of up to nine years(9yrs),the money will be transferred into the bank treasury as an unclaimed bill. My request for a foreigner as next of kin is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a British cannot stand as next of kin.  50% of the money will be your share as a foreign partner and your assistance to actualise this business,thereafter i will visit your country with your help once the money hits your account for disbursement according to the percentage indicated. To effect the immediate transfer of the fund to you as agreed,you must apply first to the bank as the next of kin to the deceased,then we will follow up all formalities for the transaction.  Upon receipt of your reply, i will send to you, the text of the application you are to send to the bank,and further clearify you in other issues as to effect this business. Awaiting to hear from you urgently.  Best Regards Mr.Brian Capon.",1

phishing,legitimate,True,"I AM HAPPY TO HAVE YOU AS FRIEND..... My dear.  greetings from miss Fatoumata Saleeby.  I am writting this letter with due respect and heartful of tears since we have not known or met ourselves previously, I am asking for whom to love and love me as well after I have gone through your profile and i just pick interest on you.   I am fair in complexion, I am about 5fit 7in tall, I love sport events, going outdoors activities, watching of moving, shopping, walking etc.In a nutshell, My name is Miss Fatoumata Saleeby 22 years old from the republic of Liberia in west Africa, now seeking for refugee in Dakar-Senegal under the (UNHCR).  I therefore write to inform you that I am the only surviving child and daughter of the deceased Dr. ELIE E. SALEEBY the former MINISTER OF FINANCE / EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CENTRAL BANK OF LIBERIA in the year July 1997-Feb. 2003.  The reason for this correspondence is to formally request for mutual assistance on business relationship with you in order to benefit from your wealth of experience in business.   The secret fact therefore, is that my father kept the sum of US$4,700, 000.00 (Four million seven hundred thousand US Dollars) CASH. The money was deposited at Bank here in Dakar Senegal.   The money is the share of proceeds from a deal executed with my father's colleagues in the hierarchy of membership of the LIBERIAN JOINT PUBLIC TENDER BOARD during a contract award to an Ukrainian - RUSSIA Diamond Extracting Company when my father was a chairman.   Due to the civil war caused by rebel leader Charles Taylor who has just been toppled by another rebel group and my father's status as a civil-servant by law in my country and the sensitivity of my father's position that attracts public attention, he cannot operate a Domiciliary account in order to keep this large sum of money in a bank in my country.   My father retired and died lately before he could withdraw this money here in and transfer it out of Africa. I anticipate to conclude arrangement to start this venture with you as quick as possible.   Due to my youthful age and also refugee here in senegal, decide to claim the money now with a foreign partner.   Upon your indicated interest, we will arrange for a meeting in the country of your choice when the money is moved from the Bank to your account and discuss in details the terms of agreement. I want to invest in any company that you suggest under your professional guidance. Please include your private mobile telephone number in your reply for easy communication.   I earnestly await your urgent response as I expect you to treat this matter with required maturity, attention and committment.   with best regards  Fatoumata Saleeby. v",1

phishing,legitimate,True,"KINDLY ASSIST URGENT RESPONSE  Hi Friend, In recent times over the radio in AMERICA or even in ASIA you must have heard about my family regarding huge sums of money stacked in foreign banks in different names for business. I believe, is a legacy we came to meet, when my late Husband became the head of state. It does not matter whether you are small or big but your ability to help me sort out things is mostly needed now. I do not justify myself but it has happened, so i need you to help me and my family survive in life.Thus it is with hope that I write to  seek your help in the context below.  I am Hajia Mariam Abacha, wife of Nigeria's former head of state; Late General Sani Abacha, whose sudden death occurred on the 8th of June 1998.  Since my husband died, I have been thrown into a state of utter confusion, frustration and hopelessness by the present civilian administration.  The security agents in the country have subjected me to physical and psychological torture. My son (Mohammed Abacha) is still under detention arraigned before the federal high court of Nigeria for an offence he did not commit. As a widow that has been traumatized, I am hopeless with my present faith. You must have heard over the media reports on the recovery of various sums of money deposited by  my late husband with various security firms. Some companies willingly gave up their secret and disclosed  our money confidently lodged there, or many, outright blackmail. Infact the total sum discovered by the government so far is in the tune of $700 to $600 Million USD and they are not relenting to make me poor for life.   I came in contact with your name and address through my personal research and would want to have faith and confidence in you as I view you to be of responsible personality. I have no doubt about your capacity and goodwill to assist me in receiving into your custody (for safety) the sum of $70.3 Million USD willed and deposited safely in my favour by my late husband. This money  is currently kept in Safe Deposit Box (SDB) at a security firm within Europe.  As it is legally required, the administration of my late husband's property is under the authority of the family's Lawyer(Attorney).  The investigative teams set up by my government have submitted their report after freezing almost all our account.Fortunately, our family lawyer had secretly protected the personal will of my husband from the notice of the investigators and have strictly advised that the$70.3m USD be urgently moved to an overseas account of any trust worthy but ANNONYMOUS foreign family   friend without delay, for security reasons.All our traveling papers have been seized by the government thereby preventing us from traveling and all the local and international outfit of our business empire seized.  This sum of money is our only hope to stay alive. I have therefore agreed to compensate your good self with 30% of the total deposit only when you recieve the deposit box from the security firm and its contents safely lodged in your account. They have equally guaranteed 100% risk-free and smooth transfer. If you are interested in assisting me, please reach me immediately and send to me your confidential telephone and fax number(s) so that I or my son mustapha can reach you as soon as possible.   For obvious security reasons, it is imperative that you  keep all our communication very secret. Do not mention my family`s name or disclose the transaction to anybody. If you are not interested in assisting me, please still get in touch so that I can make alternative arrangement as time is of the essence.Please do not expose me to my government.   You can browse on the links below for more information concerning my family's predicament.

Locations which may take advantage of such systems are airports, sea  ports,  mines, nuc|ear facilities, and more.  * As with a|l stocks, news drives the short term price. Fresh news has  made  VNBL a hot buy.   NEWS ON VNBL   MALIBU, Ca|if.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 16, 2O05--Vinob|e, Inc.  (OTCBB:VNBL -  News), a holding company seeking to identify |ong-term growth  opportunities  in the areas of homeland security, security information systems, and  other  security services, announced today that it plans to offer products and  services that wi|| assist in the automation of the identification and  contro| of equipment, assets, too|s, and the re|ated processes used in  the  Oil & Gas and Petrochemical industries.  Although smal| wireless|y networked RFID sensors can monitor machines  and  equipment to detect possib|e prob|ems before they become serious, they  can  also de|iver safety features within oil we|ls. Oil maybe trapped in  different layers of rock, a|ong with gas and water. Detection of  specific  liquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise  opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur,  such as  a we|l filling with water.  As with other RF based techno|ogy applications, RFID can a|so provide  the  safe transit of materia|s by on|y the authorized handler, and limit the  entry of personne| to specific |ocations. Ensuring personnel safety is  essential, shou|d there be an emergency at a faci|ity, RFID tags would  enab|e the customer to track and evaluate its employee's safety and/or  danger. This app|ication technology requires product and hardware that  can  operate in harsh and potential|y hazardous conditions, but gives  valuable  safety to the resources and assets that are vital to the customer. RFID  can  a|so assist the customer's supp|y chain by tracking oi|, gas, and  chemica|  products from extraction to refining to the sale at the retail level.  Vinob|e's viewpoint as previously stated is that these applications are  more  than just a va|uable tool to the mining industry, but as a protective  measure of our country's natura| resources and commodities against  threat.  Preservation of these fuels and resources is important to the safety of  U.S.  industry and economy.  The Company believes that such offering service and technology  application  in the Oil & Gas and Petrochemica| industry wi|| further position  Vinob|e in  a rapid|y expanding industry whi|e taking advantage of access to the  increasing capital and global spending that the Company will require  for  growth. The Company's goa| is to a|so provide a much-needed service at  a  cost manageable to even the sma|lest of businesses that can't afford to  do  without the safety of its personne| and assets in this current state of  constant threat.

Unfortunately he died without a registered next of kin and as such the funds  now have an open beneficiary status. You could be made the beneficiary since  you share the same last name with him.  This has officially transferred the right to you, as no other person from  his family knows anything about this fund with our bank.If you are  interested in working with me,  please get back to me as quickly as possible so that I give you the details  of what we are to  do. I wait for your prompt response so that I can give  you more briefing of what you need to and how to do it.  Thanks for your co-operation.  Best regards,  Melvin.  _________________________________________________________________ Windows Live Messenger has arrived.

phishing,legitimate,True,"CONFIDENTIAL  AND  URGENT Hello,  I am writing you this mail today on personal grounds and l implore you to get back to me in earnest. I am interested in doing business with your humble self, but before I proceed further, I want you to please note that this is not a sort of joke, I mean business.  I want to invest heavily in your country and other countries within your geographical zone as you may indicate as ideal. Once you are interested in this proposed joint venture transaction, I will be giving you a breakdown; we will start relating with each.  As you may wish to know, I am the director of P.P.M.C (Petroleum Products Marketing Company); a subsidiary of Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation,CC N.N.P.C. My office is in charge of selling crude oil to foreign companies/countries that come to lift or buy oil as well as registering and certifying each and every one of them before a single barrel is lifted.   As a result of the recent upsurge in the price of crude oil, I and some of my colleague make 30 cent on a barrel and for over the period of 2 months, we had realized US$50 M (FIFTY MILLION US DOLLARS). As civil servants getting this money out of my country (Nigeria) for investment poses a problem, following the fact that Government officials are prohibited from running a foreign account, and as such, I crave your indulgence to assist in this regard, if you wish to assist, kindly mail me back. So we could go in to business. Please Email me your response to my personal box:  (drgodianokocha@myway.com)   As the transaction progress, you stand the chance to negotiate what your cut will be from the US$50 M (FIFTY MILLION US DOLLARS).  I further assure you that this is a risk-free business, Thank you for anticipated cooperation.   I shall be expecting your response.  I remain Yours truly Dr Godian Okocha",1

phishing,legitimate,True,"Urgent Business Proposal Kenya Commercial Bank City Centre,  P.O. Box 44252,Nairobi. Kenya  Email:dan@danielm.org   Dear Sir/Madam,   May I crave your indulgence to open this business discussion with you by an informal letter of this sort. It  is pertinent that a business of this magnitude should have commenced properly with a formal meeting  between you and us to enable both parties know ourselves, have a fore knowledge of the nature of the  business, discuss and acquaint ourselves with the responsibilities and functions of both parties and  appropriate shares accordingly.  I am Dan Wilson Branch Manager of Kenya Commercial Bank in Kenya.This is an urgent and very  confidential business proposition.   On June 6, 2001,a Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the Kenya Ministry Of Energy,  Mr.Clifford Stone made a numbered time(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at  US$21,500,000.00,(Twenty-One Million, five hundred thousand Dollars) in my branch.  Upon maturity,I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month,we  sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers,the National Petroleum  Corporation that Mr.Clifford Stone died from an automobile accident.   On further investigation,I found out that he died without making a WILL,and all attempts to trace his next  of kin was fruitless.   I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.Clifford Stone did not declare any kin or  relations in all his official documents,including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of  US$21,500,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward  to claim it. According to South African Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the  ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.   Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money  which was fixed deposited in my bank. I am writing you because I as a public servant,i cannot operate a  foreign account.   I want to present you as the owner of the funds so you can be able to claim them with the help of my  attorney. This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately your telephone number,full names and  address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the  beneficiary of the funds.   The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 80% for me and 20% for you.The paperwork  for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantees the successful execution of this  transaction.   If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email and Upon your response,I shall then provide  you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.   Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable  for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country.   Due to the nature of confidentiality in this Transaction our communication can only be via email and fax  mostly.   Awaiting your urgent reply via my private email:   Thanks and my regards.

phishing,legitimate,True,"CAN I TRUST YOU ON THIS   Dear Sir/Madam Compliment of the day to you . I got your contact through business search from the internet. I am Mr.Mustapha Momodu, Account Manager of Standard Chartered Bank Kanashie Branch . I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On December 29th 2002, an American contractor with the Government of Ghana, Mr. Michael Creek made a numbered time (Fixed) deposited for twelve calendar months, valued at TWENTY TWO Million,Four hundred thousand dollars ($22.4million) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, that Mr. Michael Creek died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he did not leave a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Michael Creek did not declare any next of kin in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork. This sum of $22.4million is still sitting in Standard Chartered Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.  No one will come forward to claim it. According to the laws of the country, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to assist me fully as foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Michael creek,  so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide me immediately with your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavites, which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of two attorneys for drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 30% for you while 10% will be set aside for miscellaneous expenses. There is no risk involved in this transaction, as every necessary paperwork for this fund, will be done and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. Hope this mail will meet your perfect understanding. Best Regards. Mr.Mustapha Momodu  P/S:You can contact me also via my private email at mr_mustapha_stb@yahoo.com",1

phishing,legitimate,True,"REPLY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE   MR. MING YANG HANG SENG BANK LTD. 83, Des Voeux Road., Central HK, Hong Kong. mingyang_h@yahoo.com.hk  Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Ming Yang director of operations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd. I have an obscured business suggestion for you.  Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client Gen. Aadel Akgaal Bastaan  who was with the Iraqi forces and also businessman made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several notices was sent to him, even during the war which began in 2003. Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the General along with his wife and only daughter had been killed during the war in a bomb blast that hit their home. You can read more about the bombings on visiting these sites below:  1. http://www.ccmep.org/usbombingwatch/2003.htm#3/19/03  2. http://civilians.info/iraq/deaths_data.php   After further investigation it was also discovered that Gen. Aadel Akgaal Bastaan  did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Twenty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the laws of my country at the expiration 3 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Gen. Aadel Akgaal Bastaan  so that you will be able to receive his funds.  WHAT IS TO BE DONE:  I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Gen. Aadel Akgaal Bastaan, all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favour for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.  There is no risk involved at all in this matter, as we are going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue. Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall then share in the ratio of 70% for me, 30% for you. Should you be interested please send me your full names, private phone/fax and current residential address and I will prefer you reach me on my private email address below: mingyang_h@yahoo.com.hk and finally after that I shall provide you with more details of this operation.  Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.

I have to say that I have no intentions of causing you any  Pains so I decided to contact you through this medium. As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I believe I really caused all that have happened to me of late.  My name is Prince Desmond Hasen, a merchant in Nepal. I am originally  From Norway. I have been diagnosed with prostate cancer that was discovered very late due to my laxity in caring for my health. It has defiled all form of medicine and right now, I have only about a few months to live according to medical experts.  I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared  For anyone not even myself but my business. The most devastating aspect of the whole thing is losing my only surviving brother, Mr. Asbjorn Hasen, to the Tsunami while holidaying in Phuket, Thailand on the 26th of December 2004. Now that I know my time is up and there is no relative to which I can will my wealth to, I have decided to will and give most of my properties and assets to charity and 25% of this funds must go to charities for family of the Tsunami victims.  Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self. I once asked a friend of mine to close one of my accounts and donate  the money, which I have there to a Motherless Babies Home in India; I late found that he kept the money to himself. This has destroyed my faith in him as he seems not to be contended with what I have done for him. I have some money which is being held with a financial firm abroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and share it to charity organizations.  I am writing this from my laptop computer in my house in Katmandu Nepal where I have a customize hospital bed on which I lay waiting for my  time to come. I pray that God uses you to support and assist me achieve my last wish on earth.  You can reach me urgently. May the almighty God be with you,  Desmond Hasen",1

The company just bottomed at $O.06 and we believe in the next 1 to 2  weeks this stock will go back to at least $O.4O                    C O M P A N Y   O V E R V I E W   Vinoble, Inc. (VNBL.OB) is a holding company, which is identifying and  acquiring operational business opportunities in the areas of homeland  security, security information systems, and other security services to  provide long term growth for its shareholders.  Vinoble believes that the opportunity to build a successful business in  the security sector is unprecedented.  The terror attacks on the United States on September 11, 20O1 have  changed the security landscape for the foreseeable future. Both  physical  and logical security have become paramount for all industry segments,  especially in the banking, healthcare and government sectors. While the  focus for Vinoble is on North America, the opportunity for security  services is worldwide. According to Giga, a wholly owned subsidiary of  Forrester Research, worldwide demand for information security products  and  services is set to eclipse $46B by 2O05.  Vinoble intends to capitalize on the dramatic growth in the security  market by delivering professional services, security products, security  training, and managed security services. In pursuit of this objective,  Vinoble has assembled a highly qualified team of security professionals  offering a full range of security services. Through Vinoble's  consulting services and integrated delivery solutions, Vinoble will  help  organizations protect key assets including persons, property,  information,  brand, and reputation.   Homeland Security, the National Strategy for a Secure Cyberspace, the  Healthcare Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA),  Sarbanes-Oxley and other regulatory programs will all cause a continued  increase in security demands in the United States and abroad. Vinoble  intends  to position itself as the 'most desired' provider of, both, physical  and information security solutions - in the eyes of our clients,  alliance  partners, and peers. We will accomplish this by ensuring our teams are  the most knowledgeable, agile, professional, and cost-conscious  provider of 'tailored' security solutions to meet the unique needs of  each  client.  Management has partnered with GarcyCo Capital Corp. (""GCCC"") to assist  in finding acquisition candidates for the company, structuring such  acquisitions, and effecting a transition to corporate growth. At  present,  Vinoble and GCCC have targeted several companies as potential  acquisition candidates. Pending the outcome of due diligence and  audits, the  company believes the acquisition of these assets will provide the basis  required for listing on a national exchange.    HERE IS RECENT NEWS ON THE COMPANY:  MALIBU, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 2O, 2O05--Vinoble, Inc. (OTCBB:  VNBL - News), a holding company seeking to identify long-term growth  opportunities in the areas of homeland security, security information  systems, and other security services, is pleased to announce that as it  continues in its efforts to reach definitive agreements on the acquisition  of assets, businesses, and strategic partners in the RFID and GPS  tracking sector, Vinoble has further engaged with several additional  businesses and individuals for the purpose of acquiring technology, software,  and patents.   Following the move to acquire RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)  technology, hardware and patents for the sole purpose of specific use  applications, the Company has concluded that the need for application  support software or middleware is part of the fundamental component of the  framework which operates such technology. The Company has identified  several sources for both licensing and the acquisition of such software,  and has begun to pursue discussions to access this important element.   Middleware is used primarily to link disparate applications, both  internally and externally, to the enterprise. This typically involves  routing data using different transport protocols, translating data into  different formats and providing a suitable means of integration such as Web  services and service-oriented architectures.   Since RFID is an integral part in the tracking of both mobile and  non-mobile assets, user-friendly and efficient management software enabling  customers to manage RFID data both incoming and out-bound is important  in maintaining customer loyalty and reduces costs associated with  customer service. Management software will allow for real time visibility of  assets or product inventory, whether in transit, in a warehouse, at the  manufacturing plant, or on a store shelf. Visibility and accuracy will  enable customers to reduce handling costs, gain instant access to  shipment information and increase inventory flow throughout the supply  chain. The ability to manage data collection from a number of different RFID  and GPS devices is essential for proper efficiency of the system.   The Company believes that such acquisition of middleware technology  will be essential and will further position Vinoble in the vastly growing  RFID and GPS tracking industry. The Company's goal is to provide  critical security services at a cost manageable to even the smallest of  businesses that can't afford to do without the safety of their personnel and  assets in this current state of constant threat.

legitimate,phishing,True,"[Ip-health] USA for Innovation letter to Congress http://www.usaforinnovation.org/news/050907_USAFI_Adelman%20Letter.pdf  Ambassador Kenneth L. Adelman, Executive Director USA For Innovation P.O. Box 57052 Washington, DC 20037-7052  May 9, 2007  Members of Congress United States of America  Dear Member of Congress:  I wish to bring to your immediate attention the recent attacks on American intellectual property being perpetrated by Brazil and Thailand. These attacks endanger the basis of American prosperity, innovation, and jobs. Unless vigorous measures are taken soon, such attacks are likely to spread to other countries, to the further detriment of U.S. national interests.  Last Friday, Brazils President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva issued a ""compulsory license"" to override the U.S. patent on an AIDS drug made by Merck. Obviously, this measure undercuts future research and development on medical innovation, upon which the health of millions around the world depend.  The public rationale given by the governments of Thailand and Brazil to override the property rights of foreign firms is invalid. Issuing a compulsory license in this manner is considered by USA for Innovation to be illegitimate under World Trade Organization rules, indisputably bad policy, and dangerous precedent.  When Brazil and Thailand issue compulsory licenses, they signal to the world their unwillingness to respect international patent protection. If this grows into more of a trend  which it will, unless strongly resisted -- innovators will no longer choose to provide life-saving drugs and other medicines in these countries.  Moreover, such a move is short-sighted for the countries themselves. It hurts local firms in Brazil and Thailand trying to attract foreign investment. It hurts their patients, who will no longer have access to patented medicines which, in many cases, are the only treatments proven safe and effective.  Thailand and Brazil have no excuse for their behavior. They are not poor countries, and cannot claim to be in crisis. Thailands GDP ranks it among the top 10% wealthiest countries in the world, and its government spends little on health care. The World Health Organization notes that Thailand spends far less on health care (3.3% of GDP) than peers such as Argentina (8.9%) or poorer countries like Cambodia (10.9%) or Lebanon (10.2%). The United States spends 15.2%.  What is true in Thailand is even truer of Brazil. It is not only in the top 10% of richest countries in the world, but in the top 5%. While Brazil spends a greater percentage of its GDP on health (7.6%) than Thailand, it is still half of what America spends.  In attacking intellectual property rights of American and European companies, Brazil and Thailand threaten innovation, which is the lifeblood of our economy. In this age of globalization, U.S. intellectual property is our comparative advantage.  A 2005 study by two leading economists  the Democratic, Clinton-appointee Dr. Robert Shapiro and Republican advisor Dr. Kevin Hassett -- estimates that U.S. intellectual property is worth between $5 trillion and $5.5 trillion. This equals approximately 45% of the U.S. GDP, and is greater than the GDP of any other nation in the world.  Intellectual property accounts for about one-quarter of all business investment over the last decade. Intangibles now account for nearly two-thirds of the market value of large U.S. public companies.  As importantly, nearly 3 million American jobs depend on continued investment in biopharmaceuticals. The world benefits from the life-saving results produced by these American scientists, researchers, doctors and teachers. More than 70% of all world medicines are created by Americans. International refusal to pay for these products not only threatens millions of American jobs, it endangers our ability to produce the new medical treatments the ailing around the world need most desperately.  Both Brazil and Thailand enjoy extraordinary benefits from Americans. While American workers face expensive tariffs when exporting goods and services to these countries (including, incredibly, taxes and tariffs on medical products), both Brazil and Thailand receive generous treatment when sending their products to the U.S. under the Generalized System of Preferences.  Both countries also receive a host of military, humanitarian and other forms of assistance from the U.S. government, in addition to private donations from millions of American charities. It seems appropriate to remind leaders of these countries that the United States will protect innovation-producing American firms and jobs. Doing so now, in a vigorous manner, will save lives in these countries and throughout the world.  Sincerely yours,  Kenneth L.

You can  confirm this from the website below which was published by BBC WORLD  NEWS.   WEBSITE. http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stm Since his  death, none of his next-of-kin are alive to make claims for this money  as his heir, because they all died in the same accident himself and his  wife(May their soul rest in peace). We cannot release the fund from his  account unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin to the  deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.   Upon this discovery, I now seek your permission to have you stand as a  next of kin to the deceased, as all documentations will be carefully  worked out by me for the funds (USD 10,700,000.00) to be released in  your favor as the beneficiary's next of kin. Because after four years the  money will be called back to the bank treasury as unclaimed bills and  the money shared amongst the directors of the bank.    so it is on this note i decided to seek for whom his name shall be used as the next of kin/beneficiary to this funds rather than allow the bank directors to  share this money amongst themselves at the end of the year.  It may interest you to know that we have secured from the probate an  order of mandamus to locate any of the deceased beneficiaries.

phishing,legitimate,True,"how 's it going ? hello friend , my name is carl simmons . in october 1988 , i received this bulletin in the mail . naturally i was skeptical , but i decided to try it because i was heavily in debt at the time . i had everything to gain and nothing to lose . even if this program worked only a fraction of what the example showed , i would be a success ! well , i m adding this note here to tell you it does work ! i will never forget how it happened . i followed the instructions exactly . the total cost was about $ 46 . 00 including postage . i dropped the envelopes off a the post office on my way to work one day in late october hoping to earn a few dollars to buy christmas presents . the recipe i ordered from the person in the # 1 position came in about a week . i did not think much about it after that until a few weeks later when my boss told me my wife had called and i was needed at home immediately due to some emergency . i raced home in a panic , threw the apartment door open , and what a sight i saw ! my wife was standing over a pile of envelopes that the mailman had dumped on the living room floor from two big canvas bags . we spend the rest of the day and most of the night opening and counting 3 , 245 envelopes , each containing $ 2 . 00 and a self-addressed stamped envelope . the next day we received 4 , 274 more . by the time the orders stopped coming in , about two weeks later , i had received $ 92 , 428 . 00 in cash ! ( i wonder what the printer though when i had him print 46 , 000 copies of the recipes in one week ! ) needless to say , i immediately quit my job , paid off al my debts in full and started another mailing . to date my revenues are approaching $ 1 , 000 , 000 . 00 in cold hard cash . believe me , you can do the same thing . this is you lucky break that you have been hoping for all your life . you can make your dreams come true . . . do not pass it up ! the most difficult part was finding a good company to provide responsive names . after trying many name sources , i ran across two companies that provided the best names for this program . their addresses and prices are below : mjg advertising 200 names $ 24 . 00 p . o . box 3009 500 names $ 35 . 00 maple glen , pa 19002 1000 names $ 50 . 00 ( 215 ) 643-1328 2000 names $ 75 . 00 ( 800 ) 880-8143 marnico lists 200 names $ 20 . 00 p . o . box 2046 500 names $ 35 . 00 abington , ma 02351 1000 names $ 60 . 00 request # 3001 2000 names $ 95 . 00 making your fortune is as easy as following these six steps : 1 . send a self addressed stamped envelope and $ 2 . 00 cash wrapped in a sheet of paper specifying which recipe you are ordering by number , to addresses # 1 through # 5 at the end of this bulletin . 2 . order at least 200 names and addresses on labels from the companies mentioned earlier . 3 . while waiting for your labels to arrive , remove the name at the # 1 spot and move each of the names up one position . place your name and address in spot # 5 . move only the names and addresses - not the recipes . this can best be done by retyping the set and pasting the new over the original . 4 . have a local printshop print at least 200 copies of this bulletin . 5 . fold the printed bulletins and place in envelopes , seal and stamp them . 6 . when the labels arrive , place one on each envelope and mail them . now here s the best part - the money you can make ! here is what happens when only 10 % of the people respond to your mailing . you send out at least 200 with your name in position # 5 . 20 people send out at least 200 with your name in position # 4 . 400 people send out at least 200 with your name in position # 3 . 8000 people send out at least 200 with your name in position # 2 . 160000 people send out at least 200 with your name in position # 1 . 168420 x $ 2 . 00 each = $ 336840 in about 60 to 90 days ! ! ! of course you are not limited to mailing only 200 bulletins , or to just one mailing . send out more than 250 or do repeat mailings and you will drastically increase your earnings . when you receive 1 , 000 requests for recipe # 3 , sit back and relax knowing that you re soon going to be a very rich person . yes , this is a perfectly legal mail order marketing plan . if you are in doubt , then refer to title 18 , section 1302 and 1341 of the u . s . postal and lottery laws . a product or service must be exchanged for the money received ; in this case , the product is the recipes . this plan also takes honest work , but the rewards are tremendous . keep a careful account of all money you received and money you spend for income tax purposes . there you have it ! the secret to making thousands for yourself . read this bulletin carefully and then reread it again . think about it , do the math and consider the wealth potential this holds for you . then send $ 2 . 00 cash and a self-addressed stamped envelope today to the addresses in positions # 1 below . go for it , order those recipes today . 1 . chocolate cream pie 2 . pineapple bavarian pudding henry w . frye , sr . harold lookwood 24684 atwood ave . 123 skokorat st . moreno valley , ca 92553 seymour , ct . 06483 3 . chocolate walnut cookies 4 . cheese garlic biscuits vincent myers , jr . dlh enterprises inc . 848 n . rainbow , # 351 p . o . box 5854 las vegas , nv 89107 san jose , ca 95150 5 . magic cookies bar acw enterprises p . o . box 3004-332 corvallis , or 97333 i tried a similar program in which the cost was $ 5 . 00 . in that one , the response was only about 3 % . the first time i sent out this recipe program a got my first responses in just one week . i sent out 250 letters instead of just 100 so my percentage of gains was higher . i am trying again with 500 letters to see if i can surpass the $ 141 , 236 . 00 of the last time . good luck to all of you . it really works ! ! ! sally freisch , st louis , il",1

Email:clicfwanton@rixmail.se    Dear Friend,    It is with trust and confidence that I write to reveal this urgent  business relationship to you. I was assigned by two of my colleagues to  seek for a foreign partner who will assist us in providing a convenient  account in a designated bank overseas for the transfer of US$32,000,  000.00 (Thirty Two Million United States Dollars Only) pending our  arrival in your country for utilization and disbursement of the fund  with the owner of the account where the fund would be transferred  into.    On the 23rd of January 1996, our corporation, the Nigeria National  Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) awarded a contract of $120,000,000.00 (  One Hundred and Twenty Million United States Dollars) but I and my  colleagues being members of the contract award committee inflated the  contract sum to the tune of US$152,000, 000.00 with the intention of  sharing the remaining balance of US$32,000,000.00 among ourselves.    The contract has been successfully executed and the actual contractors  have been paid their US$120,000,000.00 ( One Hundred and Twenty Million  United States Dollars) in full. But what we want to transfer out of the  country in our favour for disbursement is US$32M. balance My colleagues  and I have agreed that if you / your company can act as the beneficiary  of this fund , we will transfer the funds to your account and you will  retain 30% of the total fund for assistance rendered, while we will  retain 60% of the total fund and the balance of 10% of the fund will be  set aside for the offsetting of all expenses that might be incurredby  both parties during the fund transfer process.    We request you cooperate with us and provide a convenient account  number in a designated bank where this fund can be safely transferred  to, we intend to come over to your country on the completion of the  fund transfer to secure our own share of the funds.    THE NATURE OF YOUR BUSINESS IS NOT PARTICULARLY RELEVANT FOR THE CCESS  OF THIS TRANS ACTION. ALL WE REQUIRE IS YOUR WELLINGNESS TO CO-OPERATE  AND ASSURANCE THAT OUR OWN SHARE WILL BE GIVEN TO US WHEN THIS MONEY IS  TRANSFERRED INTO YOUR ACCOUNT.ALL NECESSARY PRECAUTIONS HAVE BEEN TAKEN  TO TO ENSURE A NO RISK SITUATION ON THE SIDE OF BOTHPARTIES AND IT IS  BELIEVED THAT THIS TRANSACTION WILL LAST 20 WORKING DAYS, BARRING ANY  DELAYS. SINCE WE HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF BUSINESS, OUR PLAN IS TO INVEST  THIS MONEY INTO REAL ESTATE, STOCK AND PERHAPS IMPORTATION OF GOODS  FROM YOUR COUNTRY BASED ON YOUR ADVISE BECAUSE MANY OF OUR YEARS HAS  BEEN SPENT AS CIVIL SERVANT,AND WE MAY LIKELY RESIGN FROM GOVERMENT  SERVICE TO PRIVATE BUSINESS AFTER THIS MONEY IS TRANFERED INTO YOUR  ACCOUNT.    Please note that we have been careful and have worked out all the  modalities for a smooth transfer of the fund to your designated Bank  Account before contacting you. We would therefore not want you to  expose this proposal to anybody for the purpose of SECURITY and its  CONFIDENTIALITY. We alsobelieve you would not sit on our money when it  is transferred eventually into your account as you get your 30% share.  Please, be rest assured that this transaction is 100% risk free.

phishing,legitimate,True,"GOOD DAY... Dear Friend,  I am Mr.Vincent Nicholas, I am an accountant with the HSBC BANK UK.I am very sorry if this is an inconvinience in any way, just that i need you to see me through with this transfer. This business request may seem strange, but I crave your indulgence and pray you view it seriously as I am convinced that you would be capable to provide me with a solution to a money transfer.  On June 16, 2000, a German property magnate Mr. Andrea Schranner made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months,valued at 6,500,000.00(Six Million Five Hundred Thousand Pounds Sterling )in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers (the Petroleum Corporation) that Mr. Andrea Schranner died in an air crash with his family.  On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a will and attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Andrea Schranner did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork. This sum of 6,500,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the  principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it .According to British law, at the expiration of 7 years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Bristish Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Mr. Andrea Schranner. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that an accredited Attorney working with the bank here will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin.We shall employ the service of two attorneys for the drafting and notarization of the will and obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate administration in your favour for the transfer into any bank account in any part of the world which you will provide.We will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.The money will be paid into your account for us to share in ratio of  50% for me and 30% for you and 10 % will be set aside to ofset any expenses incured during the business , while the other 10% will go to charity organisation. There is no risk at all,the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as an accountant in the bank with the help of the branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. Please reply immediately via the private email address below to show your interest , upon your responses, I shall provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.  Please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share of this money in your country. Please upon the receipt of this mail message, send to me the following to enable me start the processing of the fund transfer into your bank account: 1.) Your full name and address, 2.) Your company name and address if any,. 3.) Your private / official telephone and fax number. Awaiting your Urgent Reply via my email: vinnicole@mixmail.com and call me for discussions in regards on my personal telephone number on +447024075148  Thanks and God bless.

Be informed that your enviable credentials/particulars were given to me by a member of the South African Export Promotion Council who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as confidential because of the nature of this transaction . I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On Dec. 19, 1998, a Canadian Oil consultant/contractor with the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, Mr. Antoine Blanc made a numbered timed(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty Five Million Dollars)in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Ministry of Energy and Natural resources that Mr. Antoine Blanc died from a plane crash. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a Will, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was futile. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Antoine Blanc did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my security company. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my security company and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 6 (six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as an Foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Antoine Blanc so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of one Attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account either newly created or existing in any part of the world which you will provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 75% for me and 20% for you. Then 5% will be used to offset any expenses incurred during the entire processing. Please your percentage is not negotiable. it is considerate enough. There is no risk at all as the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney, and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.  If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email address below. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. I am awaiting your urgent reply via my email: .femi-martin876@fsmail.net  However, after your initial response by email, I would suggest that you contact me via phone 234 8055467101, for a verbal and detailed explanation of this transaction .This is imperative, because I would like to speak with you in order to be sure of who I would be with carrying out this transaction with. Regards.",1

WEST AFRICA.  Dear Sir,  BUSINESS PROPOSAL AND INVESTMENT IN YOUR COUNTRY   I got your contact through our chember of commerce and  industry.  I am contacting you for a mutual business relationship and for you to act as my guardian in a joint business venture that we will operate together. After praying, my mind asked me to go ahead and contact you for this partnership. My name is PRINCE HASSAN SULEMAN, the only son of Late ALHAJI USMAN SULEMAN. My mother died on the 22nd of October, 1985 of cancer and my father was  assassinated on the 28th of April 2003 by an unknown person in Abidjan, Cote dIvoire. My father was a gold and cocoa merchant based in Ghana/Cote dIvoire.Breifly before he died in a hospital here in Abidjan, Cote dIvoire due to injuries he sustained from the gunshots. He told me about the sum of US$45M(Forty Five Million United States Dollars) belonging to him in a suspense account with one of our local Bank here in Abidjan, Cote dIvoire. That he willed the money to me in his will, with his attorney. He asked me to seek for a foreign partner Who will assist me in transferring the money out of Abidjan, CotedIvoire to a foreign account for investment purpose. Then help me make arrangement after the transfer to leave this country. That those people that killed him may be after me. According to my late fathers will, the money cannot be released to me without a foreign partner until at the age of 37 years. It can only be transferred from the Bank here to the account of my foreign partner  before I attain the age of 37 years. Presently I am 34years old and can not seat here for the next 3years waiting for the maturity date, while my life is in danger. This is my reason for contacting you to assist me present your self as my foreign partner and also provide foreign account where this fund will be transferred to.I have already contacted my fathers attorney here in respect of this transaction. He is waiting to hear from my foreign partner for us to start the process for the transfer of the funds. I would have done this since but according to our tradition. I have to wait till its one year after my fathers death as a mark of respect before embarking on such project. So that it will not look like if I am just after his money like my uncle. Since the death of my father, I have been with my fathers brother in Ghana. Honestly the way he is treating me, make me  to be suspecting him that he knows some thing about my late fathers death.  Based on this, I left his house with out his consent. Presently I am in Abidjan,Cote d Ivoire. He dont know my way about and will never know. This is why I need your assistance so urgent for us to finalise this transaction as soon as possible for me to leave this Country. You will be given 40% as compensation for your assistance and effort before any thing is done with the money. If you are interested and feel that you can handle this project. Please get back to me for more details and as well as indicate your private Tel/Fax numbers where I can always reach you, when the need arises. I await to hear from you. Thanks and God bless.

For your clarification and understanding,this money in a box which my husband deposited in the finance and security company in dis-guise as a family treasure since 11th of febuary 1998, is not an ill gotten wealth rather, it was generated from my organisation FAMILY SUPPORT PROGRAM (F.S.P). I will enlighten you more of this organisation if you indicate a helping interest to secure this money on my behalf.  On your acceptance to render this assistance to me,I will instruct the finance company to effect a change of ownership of this fund in your name as the bona-fide owner to enable you claim the fund from the security and finance company,also I will disclose to you the country and the name of the finance and security company where this money is being deposited.  What I demand from you now is to arrange for a visit to the finance company where this money is being deposited and claim it as the bona-fide owner.It is very ideal you forward to me your private telephone and fax numbers to enable me send all relevant documents pertaining the deposit of this fund for your clarification and more understanding.  Bear in mind that this transaction demands absolute confidentiality because properties and bank accounts both local and international bearing the Abacha's family name, are being ordered to be confiscated by the newly elected civilian President of Nigeria (President Olusegun Obasanjo) hence I will not want to be exposed.  Let me refer you to the front page of This Day Newspapers of 10th March 2001. You can check it through their website:www.thisdayonline.com , click on archives,8th.june,2001) The present government in Nigeria had frozen and seized all my bank accounts both here in Nigeria and abroad.

When you must have taken the agreed percentage, you will use part of the balance to buy a living house for my family there in your country, where we shall live in the future and the remaining part will be kept for investment package also in your country which will be under your supervision.  Contact me through my son (OMAR ABACHA) who recently escaped from Nigeria to Johannesboug South Africa where he is now staying as a refuge on his email address omarabacha@hotmail.com to avoid us losing this money, since it is the only remaining fund for the survival of my family.

The owner  of this account was Mr. Destin Pal, a foreigner, and a miner at D&D INVESTMENT  CO., a geologist by profession and he died since 1990. No other person knows  about this account or any thing concerning it, the account has no other  beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that this company does  not know anything about this account and the amount involved is (USD 45M) Forty  Five million United States Dollars).   I want to transfer the [USD45M] Forty Five million United States Dollars into a  safe foreigners account abroad , but I don't know any foreigner,  I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved  to a local bank here, but can only be approved to any foreign account  because the money is in us dollars and the former owner of the  account Mr.Destin Pal,was a foreigner too.

I will fly to your country for withdrawal and sharing and other  investments. I am contacting you because of the need to involve a foreigner  with foreign account and foreign beneficiary.

I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 2000, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit  for forty-eight months, (being four years) valued at US$40,000,000.00, (forty Million, Dollars) in my branch.  Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his employers, that Mr. Barry Kelly died from tsunami on his holidays in Thailand 26 December 2004. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$40,000,000 has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for Safekeeping .No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to British Law, at the expiration of (three) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the British Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to stand in as the owner  of the money I deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes though  the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as I tagged them to be photographic materials for export. I am writing you because I as a public servant (Manager with the bank), I cannot operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than $1m. I want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. This is simple. I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the as the owner of the boxes.  The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 30% for you. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email address upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in (Buying of properties like houses, hotels and doing charity works etc) Please do send me your private/mobile telephone fax number so that we can have a smooth communication. Awaiting your urgent reply ONLY via my email( ttss7520062006@mixmail.com )  Thanks and regards.  TONY SMITH",1

phishing,legitimate,True,"A PROPOSITION IT IS URGENT RESPOND PLEASE FROM THE DESK OF:DR.STEPHAN MULLER CITIBANK PRIVATKUNDEN AG & CO.KGaA KASERNEN STR.10 40213 DSSELDORF GERMANY. EMAIL.steffanmuller@gmx.net  RESPOND THROUGH MY Alternative email address: steffanmuller@gmx.net  I am MR STEPHAN MULLER, credit officer of Citibank, Dsseldorf,Germany.I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. In June, 1999, a German property consultant and exporter of used cars ,Mr Andreas Schranner made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at DM30,000,000.00(Thirty Million Deutschmark only)which is now 18,000,000.00(Eighteen Million Euro)only in my branch. It was to our utter suprise that we heard of his death, wife and children in an AF4590 plane crash in July 2000. See website below:  On further investigation,I found out that he died without making a WILL, and hitherto, all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. Mr Andreas Schranner was residing at No 1 Rue de Avenida, G.R.A. ouagoudougou, burkina faso, West Africa. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr Andreas Schranner did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of 21,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Laws of Deutschland, at the expiration of 7(seven)years,the money will be declared frozen and forfeited to German Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin or business partner to Mr Andreas Schranner so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not be conficated by the German Government. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address,phone and fax numbers so that i can prepare the necessary documents that will put you in place as the next of kin or business partner. Your role in this transaction is to send an application for claim of the funds to our bank. Then, as top official of the bank, I shall work behind-the-scene to make sure that your application is approved by the management of the bank, and the funds transfered to your nominated bank account. Please note that there is no iota of risks at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done legitimately and with my position as top official of the bank i would ensure a successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately to my email box. Please send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication. You should observe utmost CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECRECY in this transaction, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I will require your assistance to invest my share in your country. I look forward to your prompt response. Thanks and regards. MR STEPHAN MULLER Alternative email address: steffanmuller@gmx.net",1

phishing,legitimate,True,"I NEEDED YOUR IMMEDIATE ATTENTION THANKS FROM MR JOHNSON MUGABE.  E-MAIL ; mm_m_17johnson@yahoo.com.au  DEAR SIR,  Compliments of the day,I understand quite well that this message will sound so strange to you but it is a very serious matter that we need to tackle together very urgent. Before i proceed further,Let me formally introduce myself to you .I am MR. JOHNSON MUGABE, 30 years of age, the first adopted son of president Robert Mugabe, the current Zimbabwean President. I am contacting you today for an urgent assistance to transfer into your account the sum of US$ 19.8 ( NINTEEN POINT EIGHT MILION STATES DOLLARS).  I hope that you may be aware of the recent differences that is going on rigth now between my father and the opposition party in my country, this also brought about the commonwealth community sanctioning my father and freezing all his foreign account both in America and britain.This decision was carried out during the 4 days Commonwealth meeting that was held in Malawi in a part of South East Africa recently.  It will interest you to hear that i never supported my fathers treatment to the white zimbabwean citizens, and this has seriously brought about some personal misunderstanding between me and my father.I have been opposing him since the past five (7) years. Fight so hard to see that he leaves the presidential seat after governing for past 32 years On this account i disassociated myself from him and we do not have any thing in common right now.He even forced me to leave the country with immediate effect after receiving the sanction from the common wealth community, Although he thought that i am behind his delimma. In the year 2004 when i was in good term with my father, he gave me a treasure box containing the sum of US$19.8 milion to deposite in a private security company in Thailand for safe keeping, So i did exactly as he instructed me without disclosing the actual content of the box to the security company,every documents was signed and documented in my names and details.This money has been lying in the security company for the past 8 months.  Now that he sent me out on exile, i left zimbabwe to Thailand where i am currently seeking political assylum.My aim of travelling to Thailand was to claim the money and transfer it out of Thailand to any other country that will be safe for investment. I am contacting you therefore on the account that you will support me to secure the fund in good condition and also come over to Thailand so that we can both claim the fund together, and then we travel down to your country for proper investment of the fund.  I have visited the security company and made every neccessary enquiry concerning the fund and it is still intact in the security house.I will compensate you with 7%of the total sum (i.e US$ 1,386 000.00) and i have set aside another 8% (i.e US$1,584 000.00) for any expenses that may be incured during the transaction. Please this is a very confidential matter that needs utmost secrecy and confidentiality, so i am really pleading to you to try as much as possible to keep every aspect of this confidential. Please also do not reveal it to any one as my hope and futture solely depend on this money and if you are willing to work with me and assist me on this transaction,then do not hesitate to contact me immediately by sending me your TELEPHONE and FAX NUMBERS,and reply me through my e-mail address for us to carry on with the next step of the transaction.  Hoping to receive your positive response soonest.   BEST REGARDS,  MR. JOHNSON MUGABE",1

phishing,legitimate,True,"(Peace) Dear Sir/Madam  At this perceived confusion or stress may have With due respect. Sorry receiving this letter Since we have not known ourselves or met before.  Despite that, I am constrained to write you this letter because of the urgency of it.   By way of self introduction, I am Mrs Joy Afolabi, the wife of late Dr. Sunday Afolabi Little did I know that my Late husband used his position in the present government to influence the  Nigerian government to award SAGEM S.A COMPANY (FRANCE)  the contract of handing the Nigerian national identification card scheme in Nigeria of, which he and his colleagues were then offered the sum of $214 million dollars by SAGEM as bribes.  Since my husband was a care-free person, he was poisoned by his colleagues so that he will not get his share of the deal and later died out of shock during his treatment abroad in Germany when he Finlay realised that his case was as a result of poison, but thank God, my husband was smart enough to have kept some wealth without letting anybody knows about it.   However, since after my husband death, we have suffered maltreatment and untold hardship in the hands of my late husband's family, simply because I did not bear a male child [heir apparent] for my late husband. By tradition, all that my late husband had, [wealth] belongs to his brothers/family. And myself is to be remarried by his immediate younger brother which I vehemently refused. They have taken all that I suffered with my husband to acquire including treasures, houses and his bank particular seized by them. I wanted to escape to the United States of America [USA} with my children on exile, but again they conspired and stole my International passport and  other travelling document to further frustrate me. My three daughters and I are trapped in obnoxious custom and traditional norms.   Thank God, two weeks ago, I received Key Text Code from a Security Company in EUROPE, that my late husband deposited U.S $15.5 Million cash in one Security company in Europe. It has therefore become very necessary and urgent to contact someone a foreigner like you to help me receive/secure these funds overseas in a  reliable bank Account presumably an empty Bank Account, if available and  to help invest it on our behalf as well, while we find a way of getting out to meet with you in your country. These funds are kept with one Security Company in EUROPE to avoid detection, seizure or diversion.   I have had several communication with  the Director of the security company in Europe, who has express willingness to help me on meeting the company's demands.  This is why I have contacted you to help save my children and I By receiving these funds on our behalf. But you need to give me Sufficient assurance that you will not divert the fund if you help me.    My children and I have resolved to give you 30% of the total sum. This is all my children and I have got to live on.    Please, I have reposed my confidence in you and hope you will not disappoint me. I look forward to your urgent response, including your phone/ mobile No and also your fax no for easier communication. The secret codes (e.g Pin No, Secret Access Code)for this fund are safely kept with me which I can give you as soon as you express desire to help me.

legitimate,phishing,True,"RE: Redfield Deliverability Project I would appear to me that there may be some misconceptions here.     Why do we assume that by entering into a financing deal we will be any better off?  I would tell you that to the extent there was any risk in the deal, that we should probably charge someone else about 25-30% as well.     Think about it, 25% is only 15% after tax.   Has some one enumerated the risks and valued them on this deal?   I haven't seen any of that work, if it has been done.           I think I understand the concept proposed and I understand the proposed goal line, return with little or no expense up front.     I would assume that we would be willing to enter into a fixed price service agreement for a number of years?     Is Halliburton willing to take any risks whatsoever?  Alternatively, why don't we go through GSS (Global Strategic Sourcing) to look for a better deal?	  Jim:   Have you looked at this for ideas on the accounting side?    Why can't I do a prepayment of a service contract fee and recognize the expense over the life of the deal?   -----Original Message----- From: 	Waymire, Dave   Sent:	Wednesday, October 17, 2001 9:17 AM To:	Hayslett, Rod; Gilbert, Steve Cc:	Centilli, James Subject:	RE: Redfield Deliverability Project  Rod,  Below is some background on the Redfield Deliverability Project.  Halliburton initiated the contact with NNG to provide work over on selected wells based on software modeling in order to return deliverability to their original levels.  The work overs are planned over a 2-3 year period and are expected to have a lasting effect of at least 10 years.  The cost to model and rework these wells is estimated to be $5.73MM.  A test program would be conducted in the first year to determine the feasibility of continuing the program at a cost of $768,000.  If the test program did not prove out the project would be terminated at this point.  The original proposal was to treat the costs of the program as expense as the costs were incurred. Bob Chandler confirmed this accounting treatment.  This would result as Kent has indicated negative EBIT for the first 2-3 years.   As an alternative it was proposed to Halliburton that NNG would enter into a 10 year service agreement with Halliburton to model and rework the wells and provide guidance on proposed well work overs for the Redfield storage field.  Halliburton would agree to perform the test program and if test results indicate that further work overs would be economically feasible would spend an additional $4.96MM on a total of 60 well workovers in the first 3 years of the contract.  NNG currently budgets $300,000 per year for Redfield well maintenance with minimal increase in deliverability. Operations has committed $300,000 per year in well maintenance over the next 5 years to this project for a total of $1.5MM.  Halliburton has not formalized their counter offer, but has indicated that they would require a 25% to 30% return for assuming the financing.  Halliburton indicated that this is a non-standard deal for them and that is the reason for high return requirement.    The objective is to structure the deal as a service agreement either with an Enron Entity who would then contract with Halliburton or some other third party at a more reasonable rate.  Even at an estimated 30% return, preliminary incremental EBIT estimates for the Halliburton service agreement are between $400,000 to $500,000 the first 5 years and  $250,00 to $275,000 for the out years.       -----Original Message----- From: 	Hayslett, Rod   Sent:	Friday, October 12, 2001 7:05 AM To:	Gilbert, Steve Cc:	Waymire, Dave Subject:	RE: Redfield Deliverability Project  Couple of quick comments.    Prepaying as an expense would require coming up with some income to offset, and generally doesn't make economic sense.   An Enron company can't help because it consolidates, and therefore ends up with the same accounting results as we do.       What accountants have reviewed the proposal?   -----Original Message----- From: 	Miller, Kent   Sent:	Thursday, October 11, 2001 9:52 AM To:	Hayslett, Rod; McCarty, Danny Cc:	Waymire, Dave; Neubauer, Dave; Neville, Sue; Thomas, Steve Subject:	Redfield Deliverability Project  Rod,  We looking for your help on some ideas on how to implement a good long term project that has negative short term cash flow.  We have been working with Halliburton to identify deliverability improvements at Redfield through the use of  improved technology related to identifying poor performing wells and implementing down hole remediation.  This project has costs and revenues as shown below that are great from a long term standpoint.  Steve Thomas and Maurice Gilbert have done an excellent job of identifying the benefits to NNG and the upsides in revenue that are expected.  Dave Waymire has also been very helpful in analyzing alternative and economics and have shown that the project has a great return (in excess of 30%).  Our problem is that the cost for the workovers at Redfield are all O&M expenses and not capital and we have a negative IBIT for the first 2 - 3 years of the project.  We have proposed that Halliburton structure the expenses such that they come in over a 5 - 10 year period so we don't have this negative IBIT flow in the first years, however, Halliburton has not been interested and has proposed a 30% finance charge for this structure.  What would be the appetite for possibly pre-paying a majority of these costs in '01 to avoid the negative '02 and '03 earnings impact or is there an Enron company that would finance/extend the expense payments.  This is a great project that we should do, however, it is difficult given the negative earnings impacts in the first couple of years.  Got any ideas to handle this financial hurdle??????

Dear Friend.  With due respect, trust and humility I write this Letter to you seeking your help and assistance though Its difficult since we have not met before.   I got your good contact from the Zimbabwean Information Exchange(ZIE) regarding your business profile and Sincerity, I believe that you are capable and reliable in assisting this my urgent request. I am Mrs. BUSISIWE LUCY MCKNIGHT, the wife of LATE FREDRICK MCKNIGHT, the former popular black farmer in Zimbabwe who is also a Famous politician, in the Zimbabwe political arena. My husband was assonated by president Mugabe and his men because he (my husband)refusal to agree with the so called president to take the lands/farms  of the whites who contribute to make the country what it is today. Because of my husbands sincerity he was constantly briefing the press  on what is going wrong in the country and the autocratic government of Mugabe.He was assassinated on 23 November 2001 being Sunday by 8.45 in Harare,  in Western  province of Zimbabwe, the planners of the assassination are well know by the masses.   My dear when this incident occurred at about 8.45 in Zimbabwe time, my husband  did not die on the spotrather he was rushed to Harare hospital where he later died.  Before the death of my husband, he had taken me and our son to South Africa to  deposit the sum of US$32.5 million {Thirty two million five hundred thousand dollars} in a security company . And now I am in Zimbabwe but my son is in South Africa  with the money deposited in asecurity company with the documents intact.

phishing,legitimate,True,"Co-Operation FROM MR. JAMES OPOKU TEL: +233 208216645  Before I introduce myself, I wish to inform you that this letter is not  a hoax mail and I urge you to treat it serious. This letter must come  to you as a big surprise, but I believe it is only a day that people  meet and become great friends and business partners.  My name is Mr. James Opoku, the present branch Manager of a bank here  in Ghana. I write you this proposal in good faith, believing that I can  trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you. Like I  said, I have a transaction that will benefit both of us, as your  assistance is required as a foreigner. I use to head the Accounts  department in my bank head office, but last December I was asked to  take position of a Manager of our branch in Kumasi who passed on, so  that was how I became the present Manager and discovered a fortune. As  I resumed duty, I discovered an account with total sum of $12,500,000  million that has not been operated on for the past 4 years. From my  investigation, I found out that this account belongs to one Late Mr.  Morris Thompson an American great industrialist and a resident of  Alaska, who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of Alaska  Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31 2000, including his  wife and only daughter.  You shall read more news about the crash on visiting this site which I  got during my investigation;    and //www.nativefederation.org/history/people/mThompson.html  The account is escrow call account, a secret type of account in my bank  and no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning  it, the account has no other beneficiary. I have kept a close  monitoring of the account since then and nobody has come forward to ask  about the money as next of kin to the late Mr. Morris Thompson, meaning  that no one is aware of the account.  I cannot directly take out this money without the help of a foreigner  and that is why I am contacting you for an assistance to claim the  funds and share it with me. As the Manager of my bank branch, I have  the power to influence the release of the funds to any foreigner that  comes up as the next of kin to the account, with the correct  information concerning the account, which I shall give you.  I am seeking your co-operation to present you as the next of kin to the  account, so that my bank head quarters will release the funds to you.  There is practically no risk involved, the transaction will be executed  under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of  law.  If you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to  share the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied.  Contact me as soon as you receive this message if you feel we can work  together, so we can go over the details.  Thanking you in advance and may God bless you.  Please, treat with utmost confidentiality. I wait your urgent response.  You can as well contact me by phone the number is +233208216645.  Regards,  Mr. James Opoku.",1

Volume Last Month: Over 7.3 Million Shares Traded Friday's Close: $.125   Watch This Stock Monday! A Large promotional Campaign is Underway This Weekend. Some of These Little Oil and Gas Stocks Have Been Really Moving Lately. And When Some of them Move, They Really Go...Gains of 100%, 200% or More Are Not Unheard Of. U-C-P-I and X-C-H-C are Two Examples..      Reasons To Consider (E O G I):  *Emerson Oil & Gas holds a 50% working interest in the W.T. Davis well and lands within Township 23 North and Range 13 West of Bossier Parish, Louisiana. The net revenue interest of the lease is 75%. The W.T. Davis Well is located in the Arkana Field and initially produced from the Haynesville Formation of the Cotton Valley Series. With the worldwide focus on energy needs being front and center in the public eye, Emerson feels that with its first class management and discretionary project choices, the company will continue to serve its shareholders well.   *Emerson is Identifying additional step out opportunities on its Louisiana property.  *Emerson has signed a letter of intent to earn 50% working interest in the Rinsland well and Lease in Bossier Parish Louisiana.  *Emerson's North-West Louisiana drilling efforts follow closely to its philosophy of high-potential low risk re-entry projects in developed fields. By maintaining this conservative, but revenue driven philosophy and mission statement, Emerson enables itself to build a strong revenue base for the company and its shareholders, while taking the lowest possible risk in achieving this goal.

Float : 9 mi|lion 30 Day Target : 6.25 6 Month Price Projection : 15.0O  Recent News and Major Share-Price Driving Mi|estones:  GEEC just announced a 10 Bi|lion, 5-year joint venture with severa|  companies operated by the Chinese Government.  GEEC uses their Biosphere Process System to convert various types of  waste into c|ean, ""green"" electricity at 5 to 1O mega-watts per hour.  GEEC Chairman, former Prime Minister of Ireland Dr. A|bert Reyno|ds,  has secured a 2 Billion LineOfCredit for GEEC and opened doors in over  a  dozen countries through po|itical contacts at the highest level.  GEEC is CBS Marketwatch.com's #1 Best Performer in the DJ Diversified  Industria|s Index in the |ast 3 months. This Dow Jones Index also  contains 3M, GE, and Honeywe||.  Conservative estimates va|ue the company at One Bil|ion.   Solving a Dual Crisis - Waste and Energy  GEEC is utilizing the unique proprietary techno|ogy of their Biosphere  Process System for the disposa| of a wide variety of waste products at  5 to 7 tons per hour, making a major impact on the globa| waste  prob|em. This profitable and environmental|y safe process converts into  c|ean,  ""green"" electricity such waste materia|s as Municipa| Solid Waste,  agricultura| wastes, forestry wastes, medical wastes, industrial  wastes,  sewage sludge, sha|e oi|, sour natural gas, and the huge market of used  tires. GEEC generates 5 to 10 mega-watts per hour of electricity from the  waste conversion on a continuous basis which is then sold to replenish  the  |ocal or national grid.   China's Aggressive Pursuit of GEEC makes 20O5 a ""Blue-Chip"" Year  GEEC just announced a 10 Bi|lion, 5-year joint venture with Chinese  Government-operated companies, including Yanzhou Coa| Mining (NYSE -  YZC,  74.O0). The deal is structured to have 1,3OO GEEC Biosphere Systems  dep|oyed throughout China to fulfill a need for waste disposal and  energy  generation, two critica| areas for a country with a popu|ation  exceeding 1.3 bil|ion people. As China's rapid economic advance  continues, a  shortfal| of 5O0 mi|lion kilowatts exists annually, prompting periodic  blackouts in a|l Chinese Provinces. GEEC is in |ine to gain  substantia||y  whi|e providing re|ief from unmanageab|e Municpal Solid Waste disposa|  and simu|taneous|y helping China meet its energy needs.   Future Mi|estones: 1.	GEEC had a 10O Mi||ion backlog of sa|es orders for the Biosphere  before the China joint-venture with 26 comp|eted Biospheres in  operation.  The backlog is now into the Bi|lions with complete financing to be  provided by China and 1,30O Biospheres to be dep|oyed throughout the  country. 2.	GEEC's present assets of 35 Mi|lion will conservative|y jump into  the 3OO Mi||ion range, a 1O-times increasee. 3.	GEEC is in advanced stages of agreement on at |east 6 major  international projects which cou|d add 50 Million to the bottom-|ine or  1.42  per share. 4.	P/E on average for this Industry GrOup is 2O to 1 putting GEEC above  the 13.00 range without any future business expansion. 5.

phishing,legitimate,True,"for assistant Dear Sir, I am Alhaji Mohammed Abacha, the son of the late Nigerian Head of State who died on the 8th of June 1998 while in active services. Following the sudden death of my father, General Sani Abacha, the present Civilian Government has thrown my family and I into a state of utter confusion,  frustration,and hopelessness.  I have been subjected to inhuman physical and physiological torture, incarceration by the security Agents in my country. I was only recently released from detention after been arraigned before the Federal High Court of Nigeria for an offence committed by my late father. The incumbent civilian administration of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo has intensified his probe into my late father's activities while in the office and he has frozen all our local and foreign accounts together with  other assets of my family as a retaliation for what my late father did to him when he was alive as the Head of the Military regime in Nigeria.  As a matter of fact, we have been declared bankrupt and they are not relenting to make us poor for life.As a man that is so traumatized, I have lost confidence with anybody within my country as all those who benefited immensely during the regime of my late father have openly abandoned all my family.   MY REASONS FOR CONTACTING YOU. I got your contacts through my personal research and out of desperation decided to reach you through this medium.   You must have heard over the media reports and the Internet on the recovery of various huge sums of money deposited by my late father in different Banks and security firms abroad.  Some of these banks and security firms willingly gave-up/divulge their banking secrets and disclosed to the present civilian administration of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, all my family's cash lodgement and monetary transactions with them.Please my dear, I repose great confidence in you and I hope you will not betray my confidence in you.   I have secretly deposited the sum of $20,000,000.00 with a security firm abroad whose name is withheld for now until we open communications. The money is contained in a metal box consignment with Security Deposit Number.I shall be grateful if you could receive this fund into your Bank account for safekeeping.  This arrangement is known to you and my junior brother (Abbas) only. So I will deal directly with you. I am proposing a 20% share of the fund to you for your kind assistance. I shall provide for you all the documents of the fund deposit with the security firm, and raise a power of attorney `to enable you claim and receive this fund into your bank account. Also this transaction demands absolute disclose it to anybody  irrespective of your relation with the person.  Remember, loose lips sinks ship I am looking forward to your urgent and positive response via my email =. abacha2@webmail.co.za.  Best regards Alhaji Mohammed Abacha.",1

phishing,legitimate,True,"We can do this  Dear Sir,      I am DR KABO HAMMED     I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, an American oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) deposited for twelve calendar months, valued at US$41,500,000.00 (Forty-one Million, five hundred Thousand Dollars) in my branch upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract  employers, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident  with his family along Benin/Shagamu Express Way. On  further investigation, I found out that he did not  leave a WILL and allattempts to trace his next of kin  were fruitless.      I therefore made further investigation and discovered  that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any next of kin n all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork. This sum of US$41,500,000.00 is still sitting in the Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will come forward to claim it.  According to the Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.      Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Barry Kelly so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide me immediately with your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents  and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin.   We shall employ the services of two attorneys for drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world, which you provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you.      There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via email. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you Understand. please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.

I am from Dubai . I have been diagnosed with   Esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right   now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. I   have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for   anyone (not even myself)but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never   generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as   that was the only thing I cared for.     But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just   wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives   me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different   way from how I have lived it.     Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and   assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as few close   friends .I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have   decided to give alms to charity organizations and those in Need, as I want   this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth.     So far, I have Distributed money to some charity organizations when I was   well. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself   anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and   distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in United   States, Asia, Middle East & Europe, they refused and kept the money to   themselves.     Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with   what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the   huge cash deposit of ten Million United States Dollars ($10, 000,   000.00) that I have with an Asset Management / Vaulting Company Abroad. I   will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatch it to charity   organizations and use it to help those in Need.     N/B:Kindly note that 40% of this funds must go to victims of Tsunami,   Hurricane Katrina , Hurricane Wilma and South Asia Earthquake , 55% to other   Charity Organizations around the World and 5% for your effort and time.  I cannot talk with you on the phone due to my health situation, as I am   using my Lap Top Computer to communicate with you. You should respond to   this e-mail if you are interested in carrying out this assignment on my   behalf.     God be with you.  Mr.Habib Waheed  habibwaheed3@myway.com    - habib waheed",1
