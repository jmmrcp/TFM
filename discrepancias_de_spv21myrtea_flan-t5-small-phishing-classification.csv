phishing,legitimate,True,"Fwd: Pharmacy bulletin  Dear valued member! This letter is a piece of advice by IPN (Internet Pharmacy Network)  officially registered organization dealing with the problem of mass drug falsification. There are so many online drugstores on the Web today  but not all of them are as reliable as one might want them to be. Actually, only a few of them (for example, USDrugs) sell 100% generic meds  so you have to be really careful while choosing where to buy your pills. Hope that you take our advice seriously.

My father was also the Chairman of ISAMA Special Oil Trust Fund. In his position as the Royal head and Chairman of the Oil Trust Fund, he made some money which he left for me as the only heir toinherit. The money is EIGHTEEN Million, Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars(US$18.5 This Money originated from the accumulated royalties between 1976-1998 . Due to poor banking system in Nigeria and political instability as a result of past Military rules (1985-1999) , he deposited this Money in a Strong Room/""VAULTS"" with an open beneficiary in a security company pending when he would finish arrangement to transfer it abroad . He was planning this when he died late last year of HeartAttack. Just before my father died he called my attention to the money and charged me to look for a foreigner who would assist me in the transfer/investment of the funds abroad. So l would be very grateful if you could accept to help me achieve this great objective. I promise to give you 20% of the total funds transferred to your vital bank account as compensation for your assistance.

legitimate,phishing,True,"Re: VmWare -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA1  Thanks, both what you and Alex said is very clear. I assume that once you hit ctrl+g to interact with the vm, you can use normal speakup review keys, and get speech from a serial hardware synth, assuming you correctly redirected the virtual serial port to the machine's physical serial port? Did you use ssh to do the install, because interacting with the vm isn't as simple as I assumed in my previous question, or was it simply because you just wanted to use ssh to do the install, or because you didn't have a physical serial port/hardware synth? Has anyone tried running gnome in a vmware machine running on a windows host? If this is all as straight forward as it sounds, and as good as it sounds, I may not have to worry about gnu/linux compatible hardware, (I.E. modem, wireless card, on-board serial ports, ETC.), and about the warranty if you resize partitions or remove windows, when looking for a new laptop in the future.

phishing,legitimate,True,"From Mr Cheung Pui TREAT AS URGENT FROM:MR.CHEUNG PUI Hang Seng Bank Ltd Sai Wan Ho Branch  171 Shaukiwan Road Hong Kong. e-mail address : cheung_pui1@hotmail.ro    Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr.Cheung Pui,director of operations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd,Sai Wan Ho Branch.I have a business proposal for you.  Before the U.S and Iraqi war,our client Major Fadi Basem who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war early this year. Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the Major and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.  After further investigation it was also discovered that Major Fadi Basem did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Twenty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the  laws of my country at the expiration 3 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem so that you will be able to receive his funds.   WHAT IS TO BE DONE:  I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary documents that will back you up as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem,all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the transfer of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.  There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue.Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me,25%for you,and 5% for any expenses incurred during the course of the operation. Should you be interested please send me your full names and current residential address and I will prefer you to reach me on the email address: cheung_pui1@hotmail.ro  Once i get your response to co-operate,i shall provide you with more details of this operation.  Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.  Kind Regards,  Mr.Cheung Pui     _________________________________________________________________",1

phishing,legitimate,True,"PRIVATE MAIL FROM THE DESK OF HAJIA MARIAM ABACHA (MRS) Dear Friend , This might be a surprise to you about where I got your contact address. Please I got your name and address through a commercial publication via Internet courtesy of S.A.I.E. during my desperate search for someone that could honestly and confidentially assist me by serving as my trustee. I am Mrs. Mariam Abacha, the widow of the late Gen. Sanni Abacha former Nigerian Military Head of State who died mysteriously as a result of  Cardiac Arrest. Since after my husband?s death my family is under restriction of movement and that not withstanding, we are being molested, policed and our Bank Account both here and abroad are being frozen by the Nigerian Civilian Government. Furthermore, my elder son is in detention by the Nigerian Government  for more interrogation about my husband?s assists and some vital documents.  Following the recent discovery of my husband?s Bank Account by the Nigerian Government with Swiss Bank in which the huge sum of US$700Million and DM450Milllion was logged. I therefore decided to contact you in confidence that I was able to move out the sum of US$25Million Dollars, which was secretly lodged in a trunk box and deposited with a Security Company as materials of Inheritance.   I therefore personally, appeal to you seriously and religiously for  your urgent assistance to move this money into your country where I believe it will be safe since I cannot leave the country due to the restriction of movement imposed on the members of my family by the Nigerian Government. You will be contacted by my family Attorney AKINTOLA JOHNSON and my lawyer shall arrange with you for a face to face meeting outside Nigerian, in order to liaise with you toward effective completion of this transaction.   However, arrangements have been put in place to move this money out of  the country in a secret vault through a diplomatic security company, as  soon as you indicate your interest, forward to my lawyer your Telephone  Number, Fax Number and your Postal Address so that he can send to you the Certificate of Deposit and other necessary documents, so that you can help to claim the luggage. Conclusively, we have agreed to offer you 30% of the total sum while  70% is to be held on trust by you until we decide on a suitable business investment in your country subsequent to our free movement by the Nigerian Government. Please reply to this mail urgently and treat with absolute confidentiality and sincerity.

Tenet angrily accuses the Bush administration of ruining his reputation by misusing his now-famous ""slam dunk"" remark about Iraqi WMD to justify its march to war. ""It's the most despicable thing that ever happened to me,"" Tenet says. ""You don't do this. You don't throw somebody overboard just because it's a deflection. Is that honorable? It's not honorable to me,"" he tells correspondent Scott Pelley.  He also reveals in this double-length segment his anguish and frustration over the 9/11 attack, the first of the president's inner circle to provide a glimpse inside it during what many would consider the country's darkest hour in modern times. You'll hear and see his feelings on the hunt for Osama bin Laden, the war on terror and its ""enhanced interrogation"" methods he says were not torture and saved lives. Pressed by Pelley to explain why, if it wasn't torture,  these individuals had to have their interrogations ""enhanced,"" Tenet, leans forward to respond, ""Because these are people who will never, ever, ever tell you a thing. These are people who know who's responsible for the next terrorist attack....[who] wouldn't blink an eyelash about killing you, your family, me and my family and everybody in this town.""          Watch  An Excerpt Of Pelley's Report.     With the questions still hovering over the massacre at Virginia Tech last week, correspondent Steve Kroft explores perhaps the biggest irony in the horrible event. It's the fact that Seung-Hui Cho, with a history of mental illness, was still able to purchase the guns he used to kill 32 innocent people, despite a 40-year-old federal law prohibiting the sale of guns to the mentally ill. Kroft reports that the law isn't enforced because many states have laws that protect the privacy of the mentally ill, advocates for whom still want their records sealed and not shared with other government agencies. Even the NRA won't go that far. The sad fact is that Cho wasn't the first mentally ill person to kill with a gun he purchased freely, nor will he be likely the last.     Watch  Kroft's Reporter's Notebook.     These stories and some interesting items from Andy Rooney's mail bag, this Sunday, April 29, on 60 Minutes at 7 p.m. ET/PT.

It is in this respect that I seek your help to assist me in the investment of these funds before the present Government headed by the son will have knowledge of this money to avoid being taking away.   On conclusion of this business, I shall compensate you with 45% of the fund, while 5% is mapped out for any expense we should encounter during the cause of transaction, and the remaining amount should be used to open account for my family for investment over there with your assistance.   I need a profitable long-term investment plan with your company or you. Your terms, suggestions and ideas are required urgently.   Expecting your prompt response. Also furnish me with your current E-mail address, Tel/Fax Numbers (Private) for a personal contact with you.   NOTE: Please you can call or fax to the line above, it belong to my cousin, as he know the confidentiality, you can reach me direct on my mail above.

But former CIA Director George Tenet lets loose in our first story in a public venting rare for any public official, never mind a CIA director. Tenet angrily accuses the Bush administration of ruining his reputation by misusing his now-famous ""slam dunk"" remark about Iraqi WMD to justify its march to war. ""It's the most despicable thing that ever happened to me,"" Tenet says. ""You don't do this. You don't throw somebody overboard just because it's a deflection. Is that honorable? It's not honorable to me,"" he tells correspondent Scott Pelley.  He also reveals in this double-length segment his anguish and frustration over the 9/11 attack, the first of the president's inner circle to provide a glimpse inside it during what many would consider the country's darkest hour in modern times. You'll hear and see his feelings on the hunt for Osama bin Laden, the war on terror and its ""enhanced interrogation"" methods he says were not torture and saved lives. Pressed by Pelley to explain why, if it wasn't torture,  these individuals had to have their interrogations ""enhanced,"" Tenet, leans forward to respond, ""Because these are people who will never, ever, ever tell you a thing. These are people who know who's responsible for the next terrorist attack....[who] wouldn't blink an eyelash about killing you, your family, me and my family and everybody in this town.""          Watch  An Excerpt Of Pelley's Report.     With the questions still hovering over the massacre at Virginia Tech last week, correspondent Steve Kroft explores perhaps the biggest irony in the horrible event. It's the fact that Seung-Hui Cho, with a history of mental illness, was still able to purchase the guns he used to kill 32 innocent people, despite a 40-year-old federal law prohibiting the sale of guns to the mentally ill. Kroft reports that the law isn't enforced because many states have laws that protect the privacy of the mentally ill, advocates for whom still want their records sealed and not shared with other government agencies. Even the NRA won't go that far. The sad fact is that Cho wasn't the first mentally ill person to kill with a gun he purchased freely, nor will he be likely the last.     Watch  Kroft's Reporter's Notebook.     These stories and some interesting items from Andy Rooney's mail bag, this Sunday, April 29, on 60 Minutes at 7 p.m. ET/PT.

phishing,legitimate,True,"letter from smith Direct and private cell number +447024075280 Direct and private Telephone + 448714749902 Direct and private fax number + 448701310683 Dear Friend,  I am Mr. T. smith, deputy senior regional manager at Lloyds TSB Commercial Finance in Yorkshire. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 2000, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit  for forty-eight months, (being four years) valued at US$40,000,000.00, (forty Million, Dollars) in my branch.  Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his employers, that Mr. Barry Kelly died from tsunami on his holidays in Thailand 26 December 2004. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$40,000,000 has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for Safekeeping .No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to British Law, at the expiration of (three) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the British Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to stand in as the owner  of the money I deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes though  the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as I tagged them to be photographic materials for export. I am writing you because I as a public servant (Manager with the bank), I cannot operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than $1m. I want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. This is simple. I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the as the owner of the boxes.  The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 30% for you. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email address upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in (Buying of properties like houses, hotels and doing charity works etc) Please do send me your private/mobile telephone fax number so that we can have a smooth communication. Awaiting your urgent reply ONLY via my email( ttss7520062006@mixmail.com )  Thanks and regards.  TONY SMITH",1

phishing,legitimate,True,"SOLICITATION FOR BUSINESS PARTNERSHIP ATTN:                                     I am interested in your partnership in a business transaction. This business proposal I wish to intimate you of will be of mutual benefit to the both of us and it?s success is entirely based on mutual trust, cooperation and a high level of confidentiality.  I am representing the board of the contract award and monitoring committe of the Zambian Ministry of Mining and Resources. I am seeking your assistance to enable me transfer the sum of US$30,500,000.00 (Thirty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) into your private/company account.  The fund came up as a result of a contract awarded and executed for and on behalf of my Ministry. The contract was supposed to be awarded to two foreign contractors to the tune of US$180,000,000.00 (One hundred and Eighty Million United States Dollars). But in the course of negotiation, the contract was awarded to a Bulgarian contractor at the cost of US$149,500,000.00 (One hundred and Forty-nine Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) to our advantage unknown to the contractor. This contract has been satisfactorily executed and inspected as the Bulgarian firm is presently securing payment from my Ministry, where our Board is in-charge of all foreign contract payment approval.  As a civil servant still in active government service, I am forbidden by law to operate an account outside the shores of Zambia. Hence this message to you seeking your assistance so as to enable me present your private/company account details as a beneficiary of contractual claims alongside that of the Bulgarian contractor, to enable me transfer the difference of US$30,500,000.00 (Thirty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) into your provided account.  On actualisation, the fund will be disbursed as stated below.  1. 20% of the fund will be for you as beneficiary  2. 80% of the fund will be for Us.  All logistics are in place and all modalities worked out for a smooth actualisation of the transaction within the next few working days of commencement.

I am MR.JOHNSON  GUBE,the MANAGER of ECOBANK BENIN. There is an account opened  in this bank in 1980 and since 1990 nobody has operated on this account again.  After going through some old files in the records, I discovered that if I do  not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. The owner  of this account was Mr. Destin Pal, a foreigner, and a miner at D&D INVESTMENT  CO., a geologist by profession and he died since 1990. No other person knows  about this account or any thing concerning it, the account has no other  beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that this company does  not know anything about this account and the amount involved is (USD 45M) Forty  Five million United States Dollars).   I want to transfer the [USD45M] Forty Five million United States Dollars into a  safe foreigners account abroad , but I don't know any foreigner,  I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved  to a local bank here, but can only be approved to any foreign account  because the money is in us dollars and the former owner of the  account Mr.Destin Pal,was a foreigner too.   I know that this message will come to you as a surprise as we dont know ourselves before, but be sure that it is real and a genuine business. I only got your contact address from my  secretary who operates computer with believe in God that you will never let me  down in this business.   You are the only person that I have contacted in this business,  so please reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step to  take urgently. Send also your private telephone and fax number including the  full details of the account to be used for the deposit. I want us to meet face  to face or sign a binding agreement to bind us together so that you can receive  this money into a foreign account or any account of your choice where the fund  will be safe. I will fly to your country for withdrawal and sharing and other  investments. I am contacting you because of the need to involve a foreigner  with foreign account and foreign beneficiary.   I need your full co-operation to make this work fine because the management is  ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct information of this  account, which I will give to you later immediately, if you are able and with capability to handle such amount in strict confidence and trust according to my instructions and advice  for our mutual benefit because this opportunity will never come again in my  life. I need truthful person in this business because I don't want to make  mistake I need your strong assurance and trust.   With my position now in the office I can transfer this money to any foreigner's  reliable account, which you can provide with assurance that this money will be  intact pending my physical arrival in your country for sharing and I want to  remind you that your share has been calculated at 35% of the total sum.

Volume Last Month: Over 7.3 Million Shares Traded Friday's Close: $.125   Watch This Stock Monday! A Large promotional Campaign is Underway This Weekend. Some of These Little Oil and Gas Stocks Have Been Really Moving Lately. And When Some of them Move, They Really Go...Gains of 100%, 200% or More Are Not Unheard Of. U-C-P-I and X-C-H-C are Two Examples..      Reasons To Consider (E O G I):  *Emerson Oil & Gas holds a 50% working interest in the W.T. Davis well and lands within Township 23 North and Range 13 West of Bossier Parish, Louisiana. The net revenue interest of the lease is 75%. The W.T. Davis Well is located in the Arkana Field and initially produced from the Haynesville Formation of the Cotton Valley Series. With the worldwide focus on energy needs being front and center in the public eye, Emerson feels that with its first class management and discretionary project choices, the company will continue to serve its shareholders well.   *Emerson is Identifying additional step out opportunities on its Louisiana property.  *Emerson has signed a letter of intent to earn 50% working interest in the Rinsland well and Lease in Bossier Parish Louisiana.  *Emerson's North-West Louisiana drilling efforts follow closely to its philosophy of high-potential low risk re-entry projects in developed fields. By maintaining this conservative, but revenue driven philosophy and mission statement, Emerson enables itself to build a strong revenue base for the company and its shareholders, while taking the lowest possible risk in achieving this goal.

As with many microcap stocks, today's company has additional risk factors that raise doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Emerson Oil and Gas, Inc. is not a reporting company registered under the Securities Act of 1934 and hence there is limited public information available about the company. Other factors include: the company had no revenue in its most recent quarter and is not currently revenue producing.The company has a nominal cash position. The company is going to need financing to complete some business transactions and begin revenue producing. If that financing does not occur, the company may not be able to continue as a going concern in which case you could lose your entire investment.

The paper is available on the Publications page of my website, www.EHirst.com << File: http://www.ehirst.com/ >> . Please let me know if you have any comments on the paper. Here is a summary of the paper:         California was supposed to show the rest of the nation a brighter electricity future. That future, as outlined by the California Public Utilities Commission in 1994, envisioned an electricity industry featuring competitive markets. Such markets were intended to produce lower costs and more choices for consumers, while ensuring profits for efficient energy suppliers and encouraging the retirement of old, inefficient power plants.         Although the first two years of restructuring (beginning in April 1998) seemed to bear out these promises, the last year has been a disaster for California's electricity consumers, taxpayers, and electric utilities. Part of the fallout from California's electricity crisis is considerable concern-even opposition-in other states to restructuring the electricity industry.          Although a few states have decided, based on the California experience, not to restructure, I believe that is the wrong outcome. Instead, the primary lessons other states should learn from California are that competitive markets can work; competition is not to blame for California's problems; and basic economic principles of supply, demand, and prices affect market outcomes.         Section 2 of this paper briefly reviews the history of electricity regulation and restructuring in California and the problems that occurred beginning in May 2000. Section 3, the heart of this paper, offers guidance to other states on the key ingredients of a competitive electricity industry. This section makes several points:   Maintain a favorable investment and regulatory climate for new generation to ensure that enough generation capacity is online and planned to meet growing loads.   Ensure that enough infrastructure (transmission capacity and natural gas pipeline capacity) is in place and planned to meet growing loads, maintain reliability, connect new generators to the grid, support large regional markets, and provide fuel to power plants.   Encourage retail customers to participate in dynamic-pricing and voluntary-load-reduction programs (i.e., couple retail and wholesale markets).   Create honest retail competition: avoid standard-offer rates with artificial discounts and create conditions that encourage many companies to offer retail services without favoring individual competitors.   Encourage electricity suppliers to manage and diversify their supply and price risks.   Create efficient and integrated wholesale markets for energy, ancillary services, and transmission congestion.   Monitor and minimize horizontal market power (generation) and vertical market power (combined ownership and operation of generation and transmission).           Ultimately, competitive markets for electricity will lower costs and prices, better align consumer prices with producer costs, improve producer efficiency in both investment and operation, maintain or improve reliability, and yield greater innovation in customer services and pricing options.          But, this transition from one industry structure to another is turning out to be long and complicated. It is complicated because electricity is so important to our modern, high-tech society; electricity is our most flexible fuel, providing light, heat, motive power, and the energy to operate all our electronic equipment. Also, electricity truly is a real-time product for which production and consumption must occur at the same time.          Although the problems that have occurred in California are substantial and worrisome, regulators and legislators in other states should focus on the long-term benefits of competitive electricity markets and accept the possible short-term problems that may occur. They also need to recognize that wholesale markets are regional in scope and extend far beyond the boundaries of any single state. Finally, competition in retail and wholesale markets must be coordinated; in particular, it is not possible to have competitive wholesale markets unless at least some retail load faces time varying prices.          If states restructure properly to create competitive markets for wholesale energy and retail services, we should all benefit. Consumers will enjoy lower prices, they will have many more choices of energy services and price-risk tradeoffs, reliability will be improved because most reliability services will be obtained through markets instead of by engineering edict, and the financial risks associated with building and operating power plants will be assigned properly to investors rather than consumers.

phishing,legitimate,True,"(Peace) Dear Sir/Madam  At this perceived confusion or stress may have With due respect. Sorry receiving this letter Since we have not known ourselves or met before.  Despite that, I am constrained to write you this letter because of the urgency of it.   By way of self introduction, I am Mrs Joy Afolabi, the wife of late Dr. Sunday Afolabi Little did I know that my Late husband used his position in the present government to influence the  Nigerian government to award SAGEM S.A COMPANY (FRANCE)  the contract of handing the Nigerian national identification card scheme in Nigeria of, which he and his colleagues were then offered the sum of $214 million dollars by SAGEM as bribes.  Since my husband was a care-free person, he was poisoned by his colleagues so that he will not get his share of the deal and later died out of shock during his treatment abroad in Germany when he Finlay realised that his case was as a result of poison, but thank God, my husband was smart enough to have kept some wealth without letting anybody knows about it.   However, since after my husband death, we have suffered maltreatment and untold hardship in the hands of my late husband's family, simply because I did not bear a male child [heir apparent] for my late husband. By tradition, all that my late husband had, [wealth] belongs to his brothers/family. And myself is to be remarried by his immediate younger brother which I vehemently refused. They have taken all that I suffered with my husband to acquire including treasures, houses and his bank particular seized by them. I wanted to escape to the United States of America [USA} with my children on exile, but again they conspired and stole my International passport and  other travelling document to further frustrate me. My three daughters and I are trapped in obnoxious custom and traditional norms.   Thank God, two weeks ago, I received Key Text Code from a Security Company in EUROPE, that my late husband deposited U.S $15.5 Million cash in one Security company in Europe. It has therefore become very necessary and urgent to contact someone a foreigner like you to help me receive/secure these funds overseas in a  reliable bank Account presumably an empty Bank Account, if available and  to help invest it on our behalf as well, while we find a way of getting out to meet with you in your country. These funds are kept with one Security Company in EUROPE to avoid detection, seizure or diversion.   I have had several communication with  the Director of the security company in Europe, who has express willingness to help me on meeting the company's demands.  This is why I have contacted you to help save my children and I By receiving these funds on our behalf. But you need to give me Sufficient assurance that you will not divert the fund if you help me.    My children and I have resolved to give you 30% of the total sum. This is all my children and I have got to live on.    Please, I have reposed my confidence in you and hope you will not disappoint me. I look forward to your urgent response, including your phone/ mobile No and also your fax no for easier communication. The secret codes (e.g Pin No, Secret Access Code)for this fund are safely kept with me which I can give you as soon as you express desire to help me.  Thank in advance for confidentiality and I look forward to hearing from you.  Mrs. Joy Afolabi.

legitimate,phishing,True,"RE: Enron Billing Kim: It sounds like there have been some changes in the settlements group that have resulted in a billing error for Smurfit.  My guess is they are using the spreadsheet rather than the SoCal Gas imbalance statement to set the volume. Can you please check and get back to John? C Kim  -----Original Message----- From: Ewing, John [mailto:JEWING@SMURFIT.COM] Sent: Friday, November 16, 2001 5:17 PM To: cfoster@ect.enron.com Subject: Enron Billing Chris, Enron may have a new person in charge of SSCC Vernon's account now as there are billing differences once again. Hannah Nguyen was kind enough to send SSCC a bill for October 2001 for 68,243 mmbtu's of gas. The sum of the delivered volumes from Southern California Gas for the accounts SSCC Vernon is paying for seems to be closer to 108,975. Upon advising Houston of the additional payment that would be received for the underbilling, SSCC Vernon received a fax to the effect that actually 109,130 mmbtu's were due. It may be unclear that SSCC Vernon pays for delivered gas volumes, or the volumetric information SSCC faxed to Houston may not have been legible. In any event, attached is the e-file used for the calculation for Enron's review. Best regards, John Ewing  <>",0

Dear Friend,  I am Mr.Brian Capon the system and control director at the NATIONAL WESTMINISTER BANK.I am writing this letter to solicit for support and assistance from you to carry out this business opportunity in my bank.  Lying in an inactive account is the sum of 11million pounds sterling belonging to a foreign customer(Michael Gambone) who was a gas consultant here in UK,who happens to be deceased during a business trip. He died with his wife(Deborah Gambone) on board the Swissair Flight 111 , which crashed into the Atlantic off Nova Scotia in september 2nd 1998. The news of this crash was on the news which we have notified his relatives to no avail.See links below for more detail information:  http://cnnstudentnews.cnn.com/WORLD/9809/swissair.victims.list/ http://cnnstudentnews.cnn.com/WORLD/americas/9809/08/swissair.02/  Ever since he died the bank has been expecting his next of kin to come and claim these fund. To this effect, we can not release the money unless someone applies for it as next of kin, as indicated in our banking guideline.Unfortunately he has no family member in UK or Over-sea who are aware of the existence of the money(as he was a gas consultant. At this juncture i have decided to do business with you by soliciting your assistance in applying as the next of kin to the bank then the money will be released to you,as I do not want this money to go into the bank treasury as an unclaimed bill,because the banking law and guideline stipulates that if such money(s) remains unclaimed  for a period of up to nine years(9yrs),the money will be transferred into the bank treasury as an unclaimed bill. My request for a foreigner as next of kin is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a British cannot stand as next of kin.  50% of the money will be your share as a foreign partner and your assistance to actualise this business,thereafter i will visit your country with your help once the money hits your account for disbursement according to the percentage indicated. To effect the immediate transfer of the fund to you as agreed,you must apply first to the bank as the next of kin to the deceased,then we will follow up all formalities for the transaction.  Upon receipt of your reply, i will send to you, the text of the application you are to send to the bank,and further clearify you in other issues as to effect this business. Awaiting to hear from you urgently.  Best Regards Mr.Brian Capon.",1

This is not so much ""clear"" as ""completely different"", but yes, that is the principle meaning of the word ""materials"" and the ony logical reason why the author would've used the term here.  A court is going to consider what the apparent intent was -- not try to stretch the meaning beyond the obvious.  > Would you expect an art *materials* catalogue to...  Hereafter, you are trying to stretch the meaning to something that it obviously wasn't intended to mean.  You can do that, because the license is POORLY WRITTEN. Which I have already said. Miraculously, you and I appear to AGREE on that point.  One consequence of this is that some lawyer might try to play the same games with the language that you are doing here.  I think the court would laugh in his face, but who knows?  > I'm trying to understand how it is possible to claim that compilers > don't fit the meaning of materials there  That would be by using the *normal*, *first* definition of ""materials"" and not some alternate meaning that has come about by association.  There is also the point that it wouldn't make any sense to require the meaning you are attempting to press: is there even a compiler which can be ""released in source format under conditions of this license""? If not, then it stands to reason that the author, knowing this, cannot have intended to limit compilation to such a hypothetical compiler. This is yet more evidence for an intent which agrees with the obvious interpretation of the language.  So, are you saying you honestly believe the author's intent was to block compilation of changes to his package altogether? If so, why distribute source at all? Furthermore, you believe that having this irrational intent, he then tried to hide it by using a word which *might* be interpreted to support his intent, but whose most obvious meaning contradicts it?  I find that a pretty implausible theory.  Your interpretation is distorts the license's original intent by using alternate meanings of words. As such it may even be semantically correct (that is, it may be within the set of possible semantic meanings of the utterance), but it is pragmatically incorrect (it is not the subset of that set that was meant by the author -- as we can tell from context). Intent is a matter of pragmatics[1] -- the study of situated utterances as evidence for meaning, not semantics[2] -- the study of isolated utterances for potential meaning.  You're pounding very hard on the semantics, trying to broaden the set of possible meanings, and you're not wrong about that as far as you go, but that's missing the point. The question was not ""what could this sentence possibly mean"", but ""what did this sentence mean when the author wrote it"" -- which is what actually matters legally.  The rest of the license, the fact of using the license, the fact of releasing software with source code and the consequences of licensing choices all provide situational information which supports the pragmatic interpretation of the sentence in question.  The fact that courts (or we) have to go beyond semantics to understand the license is a serious flaw of the license, which I've already pointed out, but as evidence of the author's actual intent, I think it is sufficient.

Email: paulotobo2@walla.com                                             Dear Sir,  It is my great pleasure to write you this letter on behalf of my colleagues. Your information were given to me by a member of the South African Export Promotion Council (SAEPC) who was with the Black Economic Empowerment Commission (Government) delegation on a trip to the United States during a bilateral conference talk to encourage foreign investors. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in execution of a deal hereunder for the benefit of all parties, and hope you will keep it confidential because of the nature of this business.  Within the Department of Mining Resources where I work as the Director of Project Implementation, with co-operation of two other top officials, we have in our possession, an overdue payment in US funds.  The said funds represent certain percentage of the contract value executed on behalf of my Ministry by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced to the amount of US$41,500,000.00 (Forty One Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). Though the actual contract cost has been paid to the original contractor, leaving the excess balance unclaimed.  The Government of the Republic of South Africa believe that private investment in general, and foreign direct investment in particular, are the real engines for sustainable economic development, for which reason it has continued to encouraged investment in the key growth-oriented sector of Mining with sincere determination to pay foreign contractors all debts owed to them, so as to continue to enjoy close relationship, and mutually beneficial co-operation with foreign governments and non-governmental financial agencies. As a result we included our bills for approvals with the co-operation of some officials at the Department of Finance and the Reserve Bank of South Africa (RBSA). We are seeking your assistance to be the beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, since we are not allowed to operate foreign account. The changing of beneficiary's information/ details and other forms of documentation upon application for claim to reflect the contract money and its approvals will be secured on behalf of your company or your self.  I have the authority of my colleagues involved to propose that, should you be willing to assist us in this transaction your share as compensation will be 20% while my colleagues and I shall receive 70%, and the balance of 10% shall be used to reimburse all expenditures, taxes and miscellaneous expenses so incurred.  It does not matter whether or not your company does contract projects of the nature described here. The assumption is that your company won the major contract and subcontracted it to other companies. More often than not, big trading companies and firms of unrelated fields win major contracts, and subcontract to more specialized firms for execution.  This business itself is 100% safe, provided you treat it with utmost confidentiality. Also your specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this mutual beneficiary transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint us. Kindly notify me for further details, upon your acceptance of this proposal.Pls send  all correspondence to potobo1@netscape.net  Regards, Engr Paul O. Otobo. potobo1@netscape.net",1

Email:clicfwanton@rixmail.se    Dear Friend,    It is with trust and confidence that I write to reveal this urgent  business relationship to you. I was assigned by two of my colleagues to  seek for a foreign partner who will assist us in providing a convenient  account in a designated bank overseas for the transfer of US$32,000,  000.00 (Thirty Two Million United States Dollars Only) pending our  arrival in your country for utilization and disbursement of the fund  with the owner of the account where the fund would be transferred  into.    On the 23rd of January 1996, our corporation, the Nigeria National  Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) awarded a contract of $120,000,000.00 (  One Hundred and Twenty Million United States Dollars) but I and my  colleagues being members of the contract award committee inflated the  contract sum to the tune of US$152,000, 000.00 with the intention of  sharing the remaining balance of US$32,000,000.00 among ourselves.    The contract has been successfully executed and the actual contractors  have been paid their US$120,000,000.00 ( One Hundred and Twenty Million  United States Dollars) in full. But what we want to transfer out of the  country in our favour for disbursement is US$32M. balance My colleagues  and I have agreed that if you / your company can act as the beneficiary  of this fund , we will transfer the funds to your account and you will  retain 30% of the total fund for assistance rendered, while we will  retain 60% of the total fund and the balance of 10% of the fund will be  set aside for the offsetting of all expenses that might be incurredby  both parties during the fund transfer process.    We request you cooperate with us and provide a convenient account  number in a designated bank where this fund can be safely transferred  to, we intend to come over to your country on the completion of the  fund transfer to secure our own share of the funds.    THE NATURE OF YOUR BUSINESS IS NOT PARTICULARLY RELEVANT FOR THE CCESS  OF THIS TRANS ACTION. ALL WE REQUIRE IS YOUR WELLINGNESS TO CO-OPERATE  AND ASSURANCE THAT OUR OWN SHARE WILL BE GIVEN TO US WHEN THIS MONEY IS  TRANSFERRED INTO YOUR ACCOUNT.ALL NECESSARY PRECAUTIONS HAVE BEEN TAKEN  TO TO ENSURE A NO RISK SITUATION ON THE SIDE OF BOTHPARTIES AND IT IS  BELIEVED THAT THIS TRANSACTION WILL LAST 20 WORKING DAYS, BARRING ANY  DELAYS. SINCE WE HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF BUSINESS, OUR PLAN IS TO INVEST  THIS MONEY INTO REAL ESTATE, STOCK AND PERHAPS IMPORTATION OF GOODS  FROM YOUR COUNTRY BASED ON YOUR ADVISE BECAUSE MANY OF OUR YEARS HAS  BEEN SPENT AS CIVIL SERVANT,AND WE MAY LIKELY RESIGN FROM GOVERMENT  SERVICE TO PRIVATE BUSINESS AFTER THIS MONEY IS TRANFERED INTO YOUR  ACCOUNT.    Please note that we have been careful and have worked out all the  modalities for a smooth transfer of the fund to your designated Bank  Account before contacting you. We would therefore not want you to  expose this proposal to anybody for the purpose of SECURITY and its  CONFIDENTIALITY. We alsobelieve you would not sit on our money when it  is transferred eventually into your account as you get your 30% share.  Please, be rest assured that this transaction is 100% risk free.

My Dear Friend,  Compliments of the day.I did like to send to you the best wishes of good  health and success in your pursuits particularly through my proposal as  contained in this letter. After due deliberation with my son,I decided to  forward to you this business proposal, we want you to assist us .I will give  you more information. As to this regard as soon as you reply.  I am Mrs.Estelle Mamadou . I am contacting you with the hope that you will  be of great assistance to me, I currently have within my reach the sum of  7.3 million U.S dollars cash which I intend to use for investment purposes.  I therefore personally appeal to you seriously and religiously for your  urgent assistance to move this money in to your country where I believe it  will be safe since I cannot leave the country due to the restriction of  movement imposed on the members of my family by the Senegal Government.  This money came as a result of a payback contract deal between my husband  and a Russian firm in our country.The Russian partners returned my husbands  share .Presently, the Government has intensified their probe in to my  husbands financial resources which has led to the freezing of all our  accounts, local and foreign, the revoking of all our business licences and  the arrest of my First son.  In view of this I want to acted very fast to withdraw this money from one of  our finance houses before it will be closed down.My husband deposited the  money in a finance firm for safe keeping . No record is known about this  fund by the government because there is no documentation showing that we  have such funds.  Further more, my elder son have been in detention in the last four years  following the death of my late husband for charges of State organized murder  and corrupt practices. he was just been released by the Supreme Court after  the president brokered a deal with my family regarding his freedom. and he  is still under interrogation about my late husband's assets and some vital  documents.  Due to the current situation in the country and government attitude to my  family,I cannot make use of this money within, thus I seek your help in  transferring this funds out for investment than leaving the fund here and to  invest the money to profit my family Bearing in mind that you may assist  me.l have decided to part with 25% of the total sum.  I am seriously considering to settle down abroad in a friendly atmosphere  like yours as soon as this fund get into your account so that I can start  all over again if only you wish. I shall ask my son Mohammade to come over  to your country to liaise with you. If this proposal satisfies you. please  do not let me out to the security as I am giving you this information in  total trust and confidence.  Please kindly reply by return mail and please include your personal  telephone and fax numbers. Conclusively,we have decided part with 25% of the  total sum. of the total sum,10% will be for expenses incurred during  thecause of this transaction, while 65% is to be held on trust by you until  we can decide on a suitable business investment in your country subsequent  to our free movement by the Senegal Government.  I will greatly appreciate if you accept my proposal in good faith. Your URGENT response is needed.  Regards and God Bless you.

We  have been extremely busy making the house we bought  on Bomar liveable,  it  was barely that way when we bought it.  We wanted to add to your restaurant review.  Cole's on Waugh is a fairly decent restaurant with an OK menu.   The Garlic  soup was a definite hit,  and the atmosphere was great.  The wine list is  good and the prices were very reasonable. The entrees need a bit of work,  the beef was very ""Gamey"", the chicken  dishes were dry,  and the fried shrimp were a bit greasy.     All things aside we have eaten there three times,  and deem it worth while.   We have seen the menu and service improve with each visit.  Our hope is that  if enough people visit Cole's the menu will improve.  It is in a very  convenient location and the owners and staff are very friendly.

Your name was referred and recommended in confidence to me by a good friend who assured me of your reliability and trustworthiness because I have been very careful due to the sensitive nature of this transaction notwithstanding the present dishonesty that surrounds the world today.    I am Gen Ibrahim Usman one of the Special Adviser to the past Military Government in this position I was privileged to keep in my custody for the government, the sum of Sixty-eight Million U.S Dollars (US$68, 000,00) only to the knowledge of the head of state.     This money was diverted from the money,. Which Untied Nations released through the Nigeria Government to ECOMOG (Peace Keeping Forces) for its operations in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Suddenly the former head of State died on the 8th June 1998. Now that the former head of state abruptly died I have this money still under my control but kept in the custody of a Finance and Security Company/Firm Oversea.    Due to restriction placed on me since the death of the former head of state, I cannot operate foreign account and cannot travel out of the country for contract and evacuation and safe keeping of this money.    Based on this, I need you as a partner whom I am entrust and channel this money for a proper investment and in a joint venture platform in your country.     As soon as you contact me and finalize, my wife or my son will be coming to your country to have a meeting with you, through which you will sign a TRUST BOND or AGREEMENT with my family concerning the safety of the transaction and more so establishing a mutual understanding in both parties. Please be rest assured that the transaction is 100% risk free and must be treated with utmost confidentiality.    Lastly, I will be willing to offer you twenty-five percent (25%) of the total money for your assistance. Also 25% for joint venture investment in your country while 50% will be kept in your account for my private use. It is imperative to let you know that my aim of contacting you in this business in because of the good recommendation made about your good self and my personal love for your country as per investment, therefore, I will be relying on advise as regards investment in a blue clip stock in your country.

phishing,legitimate,True,"Happy New Year.. Attn: Sir/ Madam,    I am the personal account officer to the great late INDUSTRIALIST who had  an account in one of the top banks here in South Africa.    Forgive my contact because this letter comes to you as a surprise, as you  don't know of it's coming before. My contact is for you to please assist to  transfer US$125,000.000.00 ( One hundred & twenty- five million United  States dollars only) in tranches from a Prime Bank here in South Africa to  any oversea's account(s). The account was opened in 1998 and he died in 2003  without a written or oral WILL and since 2003 nobody had operated the  account. The account is dormant and the funds floating. If I do not remit  this money out urgently it will be forfeited to the bank.    Firstly, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction  because of my official position and nature of the deal. The business can be  concluded in 10 (ten) banking days .I am sure and have confidence of your  ability and reliability to prosecute a transaction of this great magnitude.  The account holder was a foreigner and no other person knows about this  account or anything concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and  until his death he was the accountant of the company. My investigation  through the National immigration department proved to me as well that he was  single as at the time of his entry into the Republic of South Africa.    The credit balance in this account is USD$125 Million ( One Hundred &  Twenty five Million United States Dollars only). Your assistance as a  foreigner is necessary because the management of the bank will welcome any  foreigner who has correct information on this account which I will disclose  to you if you are interested to do this business with me.There is no risk in  this business if you follow my instructions. Given my position and my  personal rapport with the manager of the bank, the funds can be transferred  to any account(s) you nominate .I need an assurance from you that this money  will be intact pending my arrival to your bank for disbursements.    State the A/C Details. A/c No:............ Bank Name:........ A/c Holder:........ Beneficiary Name:...    We will start with the first swift wire-transfer of US$25 million( Twenty  -five million United States only) Upon successful transfer of the first  tranch without any disappointment from your side, you shall apply for the  outstanding sum of US $100 Million to the same or other account(s). Armed  with correct information as a foreigner and appropriate documentations as we  shall arrange I will use my position to secure a prompt conclusion to the  transaction.    Your duty is to send me the banking coordinates for the transfer while  maintaining the required confidentiality . At the conclusion of the transfer  you will receive 35%, 5% will be for any expenses both parties incurred in  the process of this business and 60% of the funds will be for me.    Upon your strong assurance of your full cooperations and receipt of your  account details then I will start the process of the funds transfer to your  account without further delay. Contact Me immediately for futher details.    Thanks for your anticipated cooperations.

legitimate,phishing,True,"RE: Redfield Deliverability Project I would appear to me that there may be some misconceptions here.     Why do we assume that by entering into a financing deal we will be any better off?  I would tell you that to the extent there was any risk in the deal, that we should probably charge someone else about 25-30% as well.     Think about it, 25% is only 15% after tax.   Has some one enumerated the risks and valued them on this deal?   I haven't seen any of that work, if it has been done.           I think I understand the concept proposed and I understand the proposed goal line, return with little or no expense up front.     I would assume that we would be willing to enter into a fixed price service agreement for a number of years?     Is Halliburton willing to take any risks whatsoever?  Alternatively, why don't we go through GSS (Global Strategic Sourcing) to look for a better deal?	  Jim:   Have you looked at this for ideas on the accounting side?    Why can't I do a prepayment of a service contract fee and recognize the expense over the life of the deal?   -----Original Message----- From: 	Waymire, Dave   Sent:	Wednesday, October 17, 2001 9:17 AM To:	Hayslett, Rod; Gilbert, Steve Cc:	Centilli, James Subject:	RE: Redfield Deliverability Project  Rod,  Below is some background on the Redfield Deliverability Project.  Halliburton initiated the contact with NNG to provide work over on selected wells based on software modeling in order to return deliverability to their original levels.  The work overs are planned over a 2-3 year period and are expected to have a lasting effect of at least 10 years.  The cost to model and rework these wells is estimated to be $5.73MM.  A test program would be conducted in the first year to determine the feasibility of continuing the program at a cost of $768,000.  If the test program did not prove out the project would be terminated at this point.  The original proposal was to treat the costs of the program as expense as the costs were incurred. Bob Chandler confirmed this accounting treatment.  This would result as Kent has indicated negative EBIT for the first 2-3 years.   As an alternative it was proposed to Halliburton that NNG would enter into a 10 year service agreement with Halliburton to model and rework the wells and provide guidance on proposed well work overs for the Redfield storage field.  Halliburton would agree to perform the test program and if test results indicate that further work overs would be economically feasible would spend an additional $4.96MM on a total of 60 well workovers in the first 3 years of the contract.  NNG currently budgets $300,000 per year for Redfield well maintenance with minimal increase in deliverability. Operations has committed $300,000 per year in well maintenance over the next 5 years to this project for a total of $1.5MM.  Halliburton has not formalized their counter offer, but has indicated that they would require a 25% to 30% return for assuming the financing.  Halliburton indicated that this is a non-standard deal for them and that is the reason for high return requirement.    The objective is to structure the deal as a service agreement either with an Enron Entity who would then contract with Halliburton or some other third party at a more reasonable rate.  Even at an estimated 30% return, preliminary incremental EBIT estimates for the Halliburton service agreement are between $400,000 to $500,000 the first 5 years and  $250,00 to $275,000 for the out years.       -----Original Message----- From: 	Hayslett, Rod   Sent:	Friday, October 12, 2001 7:05 AM To:	Gilbert, Steve Cc:	Waymire, Dave Subject:	RE: Redfield Deliverability Project  Couple of quick comments.    Prepaying as an expense would require coming up with some income to offset, and generally doesn't make economic sense.   An Enron company can't help because it consolidates, and therefore ends up with the same accounting results as we do.       What accountants have reviewed the proposal?   -----Original Message----- From: 	Miller, Kent   Sent:	Thursday, October 11, 2001 9:52 AM To:	Hayslett, Rod; McCarty, Danny Cc:	Waymire, Dave; Neubauer, Dave; Neville, Sue; Thomas, Steve Subject:	Redfield Deliverability Project  Rod,  We looking for your help on some ideas on how to implement a good long term project that has negative short term cash flow.  We have been working with Halliburton to identify deliverability improvements at Redfield through the use of  improved technology related to identifying poor performing wells and implementing down hole remediation.  This project has costs and revenues as shown below that are great from a long term standpoint.  Steve Thomas and Maurice Gilbert have done an excellent job of identifying the benefits to NNG and the upsides in revenue that are expected.  Dave Waymire has also been very helpful in analyzing alternative and economics and have shown that the project has a great return (in excess of 30%).  Our problem is that the cost for the workovers at Redfield are all O&M expenses and not capital and we have a negative IBIT for the first 2 - 3 years of the project.  We have proposed that Halliburton structure the expenses such that they come in over a 5 - 10 year period so we don't have this negative IBIT flow in the first years, however, Halliburton has not been interested and has proposed a 30% finance charge for this structure.  What would be the appetite for possibly pre-paying a majority of these costs in '01 to avoid the negative '02 and '03 earnings impact or is there an Enron company that would finance/extend the expense payments.  This is a great project that we should do, however, it is difficult given the negative earnings impacts in the first couple of years.  Got any ideas to handle this financial hurdle??????

legitimate,phishing,True,"RE: Enron's Advocacy in California Jim, We can talk at greater length if you want, but the quick answers to your questions are: 1. PX Credit: Make it simple and transparent.  Best outcome would be no credit -- DA pays T&D costs only, as they appear in the tariff.  Period, end of story. 2. The UDC Financial Hole: The more relief we can get from these items, the better.  Duh.  The small surcharge ($10) is currently factored into in our curves, so the hope is that whatever ultimately emerges from the sausage factory, the ultimate amount that they try to stick on DA customers is < $10.  If our contract language ends up protecting us further, all the better, but I would prefer that not to be our last resort. >  -----Original Message----- > From: 	Steffes, James D.   > Sent:	Tuesday, October 09, 2001 7:43 PM > To:	Swain, Steve; Tribolet, Michael; Dasovich, Jeff > Subject:	Enron's Advocacy in California >  > Steve -- >  > As you can see from the e-mail chain, we are now at a  > decision point on where we want to go with PG&E and SCE.   > With the progress of the PG&E bankruptcy and the SCE  > Settlement with the CPUC, it is important that we are all on  > the same page.   >  > Basically we need to make sure that our advocacy is  > consistent with our expected outcomes at the CPUC and with  > the nature of your business (both current and hopefully going  > forward). >  > 1.

phishing,legitimate,True,"From: Mr.Al-Zarqawi Yusuf  From: Mr.Al-Zarqawi Yusuf  Dear Friend,  Your first reaction to this mail will be total rejection, scare and maybe disbelief, owning largely to the atrocities people commit these days.But this mail comes from a devastated, sorrowful and emotional laden soul that needs compassion from a kind and good spirited person to wipe away my tears and appropriate my dream and humanitarian gesture.  As you read this, I don't want you to  feel sorry for me, because, I believe everyone dies someday.,I am Al-Zarqawi Yusuf, A Oil merchant in Dubai, United Arab Emirate ( UAE). I have been diagnosed with Cancer, which was discovered very late, due to my laxity in caring for my health. It has defiled all forms of medicine; Right now I have only about a limited to live, according to my Medical Doctor. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for myself but the Oil business.Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.  I believe when Allah  gives me a second chance and  heal me I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it.I have sowed a seed for my healing I have willed and given most of my properties and assets to my immediate and extended family members and as well as a few close friends. i want Allah to be merciful to me and accept my soul and so, I have decided to give arms to charity organizations and give succor and comfort to the less privileged of the Tsunami and Hurricane Katrina Victims, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth so far, by distributed some of this money to some charity organizations in India,Hurricane Katrina victims in USA and other part of the world. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self anymore.I once asked members of my family  to close one of my accounts in Saudi Bank and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization and to the less  privileged in Bulgaria and Sudan.  They cashed the money but kept it only to themselves.  Hence I do not trust them anymore,as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them already.The last of my money, which no one knows of, is the huge cash deposit of Thirty Five Million United States Dollars ( US$35Million)  that I have in the Vault of The Security Company as family valuable since the year 2003 for safekeeping.I want you to collect this deposit on my behalf and disburse it to the Tsunami Earthquake victims in Asia for the less privileged. Please send me a mail to indicate your wiliness to assist in this disbursement.   I will set aside 10% for you for your time and efforts by notifying the security company as soon as i hear from you.I need your urgent reply with your full name and address, your Phone and Fax numbers and your Occupation so that I will not have to go on sourcing for a credible person to handle this project for himself and the rest of the less privileged.I will also plead to you to always pray for me because only Allah heals.   Wasaalam  Regards, Al-Zarqawi Yusuf.",1

legitimate,phishing,True,"Former EE300 student Sir, As you may or may not remember, I was one of your EE300 students in the fall of 1998.  The class did not go well for me, and suffice to say I was more or less glad to have passed it by a hair with a D, and a low one at that.  It was my only D at the Academy, but I honestly got out of the course what I put into it.  Now I am an 0602 Communications Officer in the Marine Corps and currently in the first month of a six month MOS training course.  For what its worth, and though I know it is cliche, I have to admit that I now wish I had put more effort into your course.  If I could go back and take that course again, I would do it without hesitation.  Little did I ever think then that such information would actually apply to me, personally, as it does now on a daily basis.  And what I failed to take with me back then I am having to learn the hard way now that it truly matters.  Surprisingly, I do remember quite a bit about the basics of EE and it is serving me well, which only leads me to believe that if I had applied myself two and a half years ago I could have spared myself a lot of trouble both then and now.  So in conclusion, thank you for what you taught me and for holding me accountable.  Frankly, your class was not as hard as I had believed it to be at the time.  And what I did take away has still put me way ahead of many of my peers who attended other institutions and have not even had enough exposure to EE (which is the basis for what we do as communicators) to recieve a low D in a ""bull  major"" course.    Very Respectfully, 2ndLt. M.W. Xxxxx",0

legitimate,phishing,True,"FW: UPDATE - Reporting to Work Next Week  FYI - Thought you might be interested in Gary Smith's response to these questions  -----Original Message----- From: 	Corman, Shelley   Sent:	Friday, November 30, 2001 7:33 PM To:	January, Steve Subject:	FW: UPDATE - Reporting to Work Next Week     -----Original Message----- From: 	Smith, Gary   Sent:	Friday, November 30, 2001 7:00 PM To:	Corman, Shelley Subject:	RE: UPDATE - Reporting to Work Next Week  That's my understanding as well.   -----Original Message----- From: 	Corman, Shelley   Sent:	Friday, November 30, 2001 6:50 PM To:	Smith, Gary Cc:	Fagan, Fran Subject:	FW: UPDATE - Reporting to Work Next Week   Okay, I've already had questions about statements in this memo.  My understanding of this is as follows:  In the event of bankruptcy, employees are guaranteed to be paid for work already completed up to an amount of $4650 (If the company were to file next week, this amount should be small since payday was today).  In addition, employees are paid for hours worked after bankruptcy at their normal salary or an amount the judge determines and such payments are not capped at $4650.      -----Original Message----- From: 	Enron Announcements/Corp/Enron@ENRON   On Behalf Of Ken Lay - Office of the Chairman@ENRON Sent:	Friday, November 30, 2001 5:58 PM To:	All Enron Employees United States Group@ENRON Subject:	UPDATE - Reporting to Work Next Week   Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today.  We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.  I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.  We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.  While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.  I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.  Ken",0

While i was working with the former President, i was entrusted with  many assets and Funds which i was keeping safe for the family, upon my  release from Prison. all the assets and funds in my possession were  all  retrieved except a certain Fund amounting to the tune of  $40,000,000.00(Forty Million United States Dollars) which is proceeds  from Crude Oil  sales of one of his numerous Oil Companies and registered with a  foreign  name under a Foreign Account and i am the only person who knows about  this Fund and also has all the necessary informations and Documents  about the account which i will give to you. It is in view of the above facts that i am contacting you as a  foreigner to help in transferring this Money abroad into your account  as the  current restrictions on travelling and the Fact that the Funds is in a  foreigner's name under a Foreign Account therefore the Bank officials  will wellcome any foreigner with correct information about the account  which i will give to you. Also there are other factors which has made it impossible for me to do  it as it was only possible for me to escape from Iraq to Kuwait from  where i am currently contacting you. We are going to sign a Binding agreement of Trust to makle sure that  none of the parties involved will be cheated in the transaction as i  will  travel along with my family to your Country for sharing and  Investments as soon as the ban on travelling and other restrictions is  lifted. You also have to note that after the successful transfer of the fund to  your account, it will be shared as follows: you will be given 35% of  the Total Fund for your services, 60% will be for me while the  remaining  5% will be for expenses incurred in the course of the transaction. I look forward to your positive and co-operative response. Yours, Barrister Al Mohammed El Said.",1

phishing,legitimate,True,"REPLY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE   MR. MING YANG HANG SENG BANK LTD. 83, Des Voeux Road., Central HK, Hong Kong. mingyang_h@yahoo.com.hk  Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Ming Yang director of operations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd. I have an obscured business suggestion for you.  Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client Gen. Aadel Akgaal Bastaan  who was with the Iraqi forces and also businessman made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several notices was sent to him, even during the war which began in 2003. Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the General along with his wife and only daughter had been killed during the war in a bomb blast that hit their home. You can read more about the bombings on visiting these sites below:  1. http://www.ccmep.org/usbombingwatch/2003.htm#3/19/03  2. http://civilians.info/iraq/deaths_data.php   After further investigation it was also discovered that Gen. Aadel Akgaal Bastaan  did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Twenty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the laws of my country at the expiration 3 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Gen. Aadel Akgaal Bastaan  so that you will be able to receive his funds.  WHAT IS TO BE DONE:  I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Gen. Aadel Akgaal Bastaan, all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favour for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.  There is no risk involved at all in this matter, as we are going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue. Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall then share in the ratio of 70% for me, 30% for you. Should you be interested please send me your full names, private phone/fax and current residential address and I will prefer you reach me on my private email address below: mingyang_h@yahoo.com.hk and finally after that I shall provide you with more details of this operation.  Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.

phishing,legitimate,True,"YOUR URGENT FUND TRANSFER ASSISTANT IS NEEDED PLEASE Dear Friend,   With warm heart I offer my friendship, and my greetings, and I hope this letter meets you in good time. It will be surprising for you to receive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally. However, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction, which I propose with my free mind and as a person of integrity.  My name is Peter  Steven the first son of  Dr Steven Ubanko a  farmer from Zimbabwe, murdered in the land dispute. As led by my instinct , I decided to contact you through LETTER as it is the only means I can contact anybody since I am cutting off ties with Zimbabwe for security and safety reasons.  However, I apologize if this is not acceptable to you.     The purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance in a business venture. Due to the land and political problems in Zimbabwe, as a result of President Robert Mugabe's introduction of new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and the few  rich black farmers, and his desire to hold on to power for life, my father foresaw the danger that is coming to Zimbabwe. Before he was murdered, he withdrew all of our business foreign accounts in dollars to Johannesburg, South Africa to deposit the sum of US$14 millions(Fourteen  million,  US dollars), in a private security company.  This money was deposited with this Private Security Company for safety and security reasons, and was to be used for the purchase of land, new machines and chemicals establishment of new farms in Botswana.  I am currently staying in The Netherlands where I am seeking political asylum. In fact my decision to come here to seek asylum, is because the financial company from South Africa, has a branch here, and they have moved the deposited fund from their office in Johannesburg to Netherland  Since the law of The Netherlands prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction,  this is why  I am seeking your help as a reliable partner, If you accept to assist me, we shall negotiate your percentage of the total sum of the fund as my partner.  All I want you to do for me, is to assist with arrangements to claim the deposit from the financial institution, from their office here in  The Netherlands, as it has now been transferred from Johannesburg, South Africa to their branch here.  The company will be legally informed of you representing me.Please, I want you to  maintain the absolute secrecy for the purpose  of this transaction.  I look forward to your reply and co-operation, and I  thank you in advance as I anticipate your co-operation,  I will like if you  reply with my email address which is petersteven5@netscape.net  Thanks you sir, Peter Steven Ubanko",1

EMAIL.steffanmuller@gmx.net  RESPOND THROUGH MY Alternative email address: steffanmuller@gmx.net  I am MR STEPHAN MULLER, credit officer of Citibank, Dsseldorf,Germany.I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. In June, 1999, a German property consultant and exporter of used cars ,Mr Andreas Schranner made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at DM30,000,000.00(Thirty Million Deutschmark only)which is now 18,000,000.00(Eighteen Million Euro)only in my branch. It was to our utter suprise that we heard of his death, wife and children in an AF4590 plane crash in July 2000. See website below:  On further investigation,I found out that he died without making a WILL, and hitherto, all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. Mr Andreas Schranner was residing at No 1 Rue de Avenida, G.R.A. ouagoudougou, burkina faso, West Africa. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr Andreas Schranner did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of 21,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Laws of Deutschland, at the expiration of 7(seven)years,the money will be declared frozen and forfeited to German Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin or business partner to Mr Andreas Schranner so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not be conficated by the German Government. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address,phone and fax numbers so that i can prepare the necessary documents that will put you in place as the next of kin or business partner. Your role in this transaction is to send an application for claim of the funds to our bank. Then, as top official of the bank, I shall work behind-the-scene to make sure that your application is approved by the management of the bank, and the funds transfered to your nominated bank account. Please note that there is no iota of risks at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done legitimately and with my position as top official of the bank i would ensure a successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately to my email box. Please send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication. You should observe utmost CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECRECY in this transaction, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I will require your assistance to invest my share in your country. I look forward to your prompt response. Thanks and regards. MR STEPHAN MULLER Alternative email address: steffanmuller@gmx.net",1

phishing,legitimate,True,"THE GREATEST IS LOVE  Dear Friend, As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because,I  believe everyone will die someday.  My name is Umaru Aliyu, a merchant in Dubai, in the U.A.E.I have been  diagnosed with Esophageal cancer caring for my health.It has defiled  all forms of medicine, and right now I have only about a few months to  live, according to medical experts.I have not particularly lived my  life so well, as I never really cared for anyone not even myself but my  business.  Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to  people and only focus on my business as that was the only thing I cared  for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life  than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.I believe  when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it.Now that God  has called me, I have willed and given most of my properties and assets  to my immediate and extended family members and as well as a few close friends. I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul and so, I have decided to give alms to charity organizations,as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I did on earth.  So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the  U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so  badly, I cannot do this my self any more. I once asked members of my  family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I  have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan,they refused  and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seems not to be contended with what I have left for them.  The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of  twenty four million dollars $24,000,000,that I have with a  Bank/Security Company abroad. I will want you to help me collect this  deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations.Please indicate your  intention to help through this email Address (aliyuumaru@mail2world.com)immediately.  And always remember that I have set aside 20% for you for your time  and patience.I await your urgent response to this request.Thanks may  God bless you and your family (AMEN).  Thanks Regards Mr Umaru Aliyu    ___________________________________________________________________________ Este mail ha sido enviado desde donde los Alvarado - http://www.alvarado.cl",1

phishing,legitimate,True,"VERY IMPORTANT. From: Mr.Anuka Ifufeh. 19floor Eugene Marais Avenue,  Constantia,  South  Africa  Dear   I sincerely ask for forgiveness for I know this  may  seem like a complete intrusion to your privacy but right about now  this is my option of communication. This mail might come to you as a  surprise and the temptation to ignore it as unserious could  come into  your mind; but please consider it a divine wish and accept it with a  deep sense of humility.   I am Mr.Anuka Ifufeh, the Auditor General of  NED BANK PLC here South Africa, during the  course of our auditing, I  discovered a floating fund in an account opened in the bank 1995 and  since 1998 nobody has operated on this account again.After going  through some old files in the records I discovered that the owner of  the account died without a [heir] hence  the money is floating and if I  do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing.  The owner of this account is Mr. Franklin Sullivan, a foreigner, a  miner and an industrialist.He made millions of dollars before he died  misteriously .Since 1998 no other person knows about this account or  any thing concerning it. My investigation proved to me that the account  has no other beneficiary and that Mr. Franklin Sullivan until his death  was the manager Sullivan Coy. (pty). SA. We will start the first  transfer with Thirty six million dollars [$36,000,000.00] upon  successful transaction without any disappoint from your side, we shall  re-apply for the payment of the remaining amount to your account.  The  amount involved is (USD $136M) Thirty Six Million United States Dollars  only. I want to first transfer $36,000.000 [Thirty Six Million United  States Dollar] from this money into a safe foreigners account abroad  before the rest, but I don't know any foreigner.  I am revealing this  to you with believing God that you will never let me down in this  business. Also send your private telephone number and fax number  including the full details of the account to be used for the deposit. I  need your strong assurance that you will never let me down in this  business proposition. With my influence and the position of a bank  official whom is working in our favour we can transfer this money to  any foreigner's reliable account which you can provide with assurance  that this money will be intact pending our physical arrival  in your  country for sharing.   The bank official will destroy all documents of  transaction immediately we receive this money leaving no trace to any  place and to build confidence you can come immediately to discuss with  me face to face after which I will make this remittance in your  presence and three of us will fly to your country@least two days ahead  of the money going into the account.   At the conclusion of this  business, you will be given 35% of the total amount, 60% will be  for  me, while 5% will be for expenses both parties might have incurred  during the process of transferring.  Best Regards, Mr.Anuka Ifufeh.  NB: YOU SHOULD SEND ME YOUR TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBER IN YOUR REPLY FOR  EASY  COMMUNICATION.",1

It's certainly possible to have getpass() read from stdin automatically, but it's traditionally understood that having it read from a tty is much, much better.  Suppose your program were meant to use getpass, and then read a file from stdin.  Now, all of a sudden, you miss the first line of the file, and it becomes your password, for no particular reason.  getpass() works the way it does because it's been working that way in C for decades.  If you really want to maintain a 'configuration file' for your password, or have it available on command line, try adding an option like -p  or -p  to whatever program you're writing.  --  Cheers, Leif _______________________________________________ Python-Dev mailing list zvllln-eum@python.org http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-dev Unsubscribe: http://mail.python.org/mailman/options/python-dev/python-dev%40tangomu.com",0

He is expected to miss the game, however, so be sure to put him on reserve this week.  James Allen , RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01 With Anthony Thomas ailing, Allen will likely start Sunday's game against Minnesota. Considering the Vikings lack of a solid run defense, Allen would be a good Fantasy start in Week 11. !  Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - Martin Updated 11/23/01 According to publised reports, Thomas has been listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Minnesota. Thomas is nursing a hamstring injury, and will likely be replaced in the starting lineup by James Allen.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/23/01 Smith played Thursday but was ineffective. He gained only nine yards on nine carries. Smith remained on the sidelines for most of the second half.  Damon Jones , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01 The Jacksonville Jaguars placed Jones on the waivers-injured reserve list Thursday, effectively ending his five-year career with the team. He caught just eight passes this year before being sidelined with a shoulder injury.  James Stewart , RB DET - Hunter Updated 11/23/01 Stewart rushed for 102 yards on 14 carries Thursday, but left the game early with a stinger in his neck. He had missed the previous four games with a sprained right ankle, and is now listed as day to day.  Charlie Batch , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01 Batch was 8-of-19 for 118 yards with no touchdowns, an interception and a fumble before Mike McMahon, who played one series in the first half, replaced him midway through the fourth quarter. Batch said he couldn't plant and throw effectively because of a groin pull. His status for next week's game is uncertain.  Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01 Banks, who sustained a concussion in last week's game at Denver, returned to practice Thursday and remained on course to start Sunday's game at Philadelphia. He sat out Wednesday's practice as a precaution, but all his postgame tests were negative. Kent Graham, who relieved Banks in the 17-10 victory over the Broncos, will start if Banks has a setback.  Rod Smith , WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/23/01 Smith had seven catches for 81 yards Thursday despite playing on a sprained ankle. He also went over 1,000 yards for the fifth straight season. Smith might be the best receiver in football and is a must start every week.  Terrell Davis , RB DEN - JWillie Updated 11/23/01 Davis could be back next week at Miami. He has missed the last two games because of a torn meniscus. Olandis Gary , RB DEN - Frank Updated 11/23/01 Gary broke a bone in his left leg on the second drive of Thursday's game. He is likely out for the rest of the season. Mike Anderson will be the primary back, but Terrell Davis might be able to return next week.  Jeff Graham , WR SD - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Graham has been quiet recently, but may bust out of a mini-slump against the Cardinals. His yardage numbers should be respectable, and he may catch a TD pass. Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Giggles Updated 11/21/01 The loss of tight end Mark Bruener could have an adverse impact on Bettis' output over the final weeks of the season, but you still need to start him every week in your league. Bettis is likely to struggle against a decent Titans rush defense on Sunday, but he'll still give you serviceable stats and may even find the end zone. Curtis Conway , WR SD - Giggles Updated 11/21/01Expect a big game from Conway in Week 11. The Arizona pass defense has been very soft all year long. Kordell Stewart , QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 While the Steelers' passing game has improved in recent weeks, Stewart is still far too inconsistent to merit using on a weekly basis. He faces a weak Tennessee secondary on Sunday, which is a good matchup, but only use him if you're desperate for a starter in your league. Darrell Jackson , WR SEA - Hunter Updated 11/21/01 Jackson should play very well at Kansas City this week. Seattle will use their passing game early on to open up running lanes for Shaun Alexander, and Jackson will be a key receiver for Matt Hasselbeck. Tim Brown , WR OAK - Martin Updated 11/21/01 Raiders QB Rich Gannon should have plenty of time to locate Brown downfield in their game against the Giants on Sunday. Definitely get Brown into your active lineup this week. Charlie Garner , RB OAK - Russell Updated 11/21/01 Don't expect Garner to put up good stats against the Giants on Sunda! y.! Tyrone Wheatley has returned from an injury and New York is tough on the run. Only use Garner if you don't have another alternative on your roster. David Patten , WR NE - JWillie Updated 11/21/01 Patten and the Patriots go up against the Saints on Sunday. While he has been inconsistent all year long, this is a favorable matchup for the wideout. Patten could beat Fred Thomas downfield for a score, and you should consider using him as your No. 2 or 3 receiver. Troy Brown , WR NE - Bass/Hull Updated 11/21/01 Brown has been a very reliable receiver for his owners this season, and has only gotten better since Tom Brady has been throwing him the ball. Expect another solid week for Brown against a mediocre Saints secondary. Antowain Smith , RB NE - JWillie Updated 11/21/01 Smith has been a pleasant surprise for his Fantasy owners this season. He'll go up against a subpar Saints rush defense on Sunday, and we recommend you get him into your active lineup as a result. Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Matty Updated 11/21/01 Gadsden has been very inconsist! en! t this season, and we don't recommend you use him this week against the Bills. Let him prove himself before you consider putting him back into your active lineup the remainder of the season. James McKnight , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 There is a possibility McKnight could beat the Bills downfield for a few long passes on Sunday. However, he is only worth using in very deep leagues. Travis Minor , RB MIA - Giggles Updated 11/21/01 The Dolphins may use Minor a fair amount Sunday against Buffalo to keep the defense honest. He could be worth using in a deep league since the Bills have been weak against the run all season. Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - Russell Updated 11/21/01 Gonzalez will rack up good Fantasy stats Sunday against the Seahawks. While he has been somewhat of a disappointment, you need to keep him active every week. Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 11/21/01 Davis rushed for 84 yards against Denver last week, and was held out of the end zone once a! ga! in. He may struggle against Philadelphia in Week 11, but you may have no choice but to start him considering the lack of running back depth around the league.  Larry Parker , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Parker could get a touchdown pass Sunday against Seattle, as the Seahawks' secondary has regularly been burned by teams' second wideout options. He might make a good No. 3 receiver for this week. Tony Richardson , RB KC - Neal/McKay Updated 11/21/01 Richardson has fallen into a goal-line back role in recent games, and there's a chance he'll get a score against the Seahawks on Sunday. Kansas City should move the ball with relative ease, and if you are in a deep league or a touchdown-only league, he might be worth putting in your lineup. Priest Holmes , RB KC - Russell Updated 11/21/01 The Chiefs will use many plays to keep the Seahawks off balance on Sunday, which should help Holmes roll up some very good stats this week. We recommend you get him into your active lineup despite his struggles against the Jets in Week Nine. Trent Green , QB KC - Bass! /H! ull Updated 11/21/01 Green and the Chiefs slumped badly before their bye week, but should rebound Sunday against Seattle. Expect him to post decent stats against this questionable secondary, but don't rush to start him over a less mistake-prone quarterback.

Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 3years now I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased so that the proceeds of this account valued at 10 million USD can be paid to you and then you and me can share the money 50% to me and 50% to you. I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim we may make like the Certificate of Deposit and Copy of Agreement issued to my client on the date of deposit, I also have a copy of the death Certificate of my client.

I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.

legitimate,phishing,True,"[Ip-health] USA for Innovation letter to Congress http://www.usaforinnovation.org/news/050907_USAFI_Adelman%20Letter.pdf  Ambassador Kenneth L. Adelman, Executive Director USA For Innovation P.O. Box 57052 Washington, DC 20037-7052  May 9, 2007  Members of Congress United States of America  Dear Member of Congress:  I wish to bring to your immediate attention the recent attacks on American intellectual property being perpetrated by Brazil and Thailand. These attacks endanger the basis of American prosperity, innovation, and jobs. Unless vigorous measures are taken soon, such attacks are likely to spread to other countries, to the further detriment of U.S. national interests.  Last Friday, Brazils President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva issued a ""compulsory license"" to override the U.S. patent on an AIDS drug made by Merck. Obviously, this measure undercuts future research and development on medical innovation, upon which the health of millions around the world depend.  The public rationale given by the governments of Thailand and Brazil to override the property rights of foreign firms is invalid. Issuing a compulsory license in this manner is considered by USA for Innovation to be illegitimate under World Trade Organization rules, indisputably bad policy, and dangerous precedent.  When Brazil and Thailand issue compulsory licenses, they signal to the world their unwillingness to respect international patent protection. If this grows into more of a trend  which it will, unless strongly resisted -- innovators will no longer choose to provide life-saving drugs and other medicines in these countries.  Moreover, such a move is short-sighted for the countries themselves. It hurts local firms in Brazil and Thailand trying to attract foreign investment. It hurts their patients, who will no longer have access to patented medicines which, in many cases, are the only treatments proven safe and effective.  Thailand and Brazil have no excuse for their behavior. They are not poor countries, and cannot claim to be in crisis. Thailands GDP ranks it among the top 10% wealthiest countries in the world, and its government spends little on health care. The World Health Organization notes that Thailand spends far less on health care (3.3% of GDP) than peers such as Argentina (8.9%) or poorer countries like Cambodia (10.9%) or Lebanon (10.2%). The United States spends 15.2%.  What is true in Thailand is even truer of Brazil. It is not only in the top 10% of richest countries in the world, but in the top 5%. While Brazil spends a greater percentage of its GDP on health (7.6%) than Thailand, it is still half of what America spends.  In attacking intellectual property rights of American and European companies, Brazil and Thailand threaten innovation, which is the lifeblood of our economy. In this age of globalization, U.S. intellectual property is our comparative advantage.  A 2005 study by two leading economists  the Democratic, Clinton-appointee Dr. Robert Shapiro and Republican advisor Dr. Kevin Hassett -- estimates that U.S. intellectual property is worth between $5 trillion and $5.5 trillion. This equals approximately 45% of the U.S. GDP, and is greater than the GDP of any other nation in the world.  Intellectual property accounts for about one-quarter of all business investment over the last decade. Intangibles now account for nearly two-thirds of the market value of large U.S. public companies.  As importantly, nearly 3 million American jobs depend on continued investment in biopharmaceuticals. The world benefits from the life-saving results produced by these American scientists, researchers, doctors and teachers. More than 70% of all world medicines are created by Americans. International refusal to pay for these products not only threatens millions of American jobs, it endangers our ability to produce the new medical treatments the ailing around the world need most desperately.  Both Brazil and Thailand enjoy extraordinary benefits from Americans. While American workers face expensive tariffs when exporting goods and services to these countries (including, incredibly, taxes and tariffs on medical products), both Brazil and Thailand receive generous treatment when sending their products to the U.S. under the Generalized System of Preferences.  Both countries also receive a host of military, humanitarian and other forms of assistance from the U.S. government, in addition to private donations from millions of American charities. It seems appropriate to remind leaders of these countries that the United States will protect innovation-producing American firms and jobs. Doing so now, in a vigorous manner, will save lives in these countries and throughout the world.  Sincerely yours,  Kenneth L.

phishing,legitimate,True,"business Dear Sir/Madam,  I am contacting you on a transfer of a huge sum. of money from a deseased. Though I know that a  transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day.  Introduction:  My name is Mr. Keykhosrow Sobhe and l am the Solicitor to Mr. Robert who died on a plane crash with his entire family on the 11th of September 2001 along side other passengers in flight 175. from Boston, Massachusetts to Los Angeles California, it was the second hijacked plane to strike the World. Trade Center plugging into the South Tower. Two pilots and seven flight attendants and fifty-seven(57) passengers were on board.  Since Mr. Roberts death, there has not been any application to claim his money by a next-of-kin as his wife who was supposed to be his next-of-kin died along side with my late client in the same accident. After 4 years of dormancy any such accounts holding funds of certain magnitudes will be re-directed to the bank treasury as unclaimed funds  and will be shared among the bank share holders. After which the file will  be closed. This is what I am trying to prevent from happening. I will rather see the whole money go directly to charity organization with a help of a foreigner.  If you share the same ideology as myself, please do not hesitate to contact me. However, it may interest you to know that we have secured from probate  and order of mandamus to locate any of the diseased surviving next-of-kin. upon this discovery. I now seek your permission to have you stand as a next-of-kin to the deceased.  All documentation will be carefully worked out by me for the funds to be released into your favor as the beneficiary's next-of-kin.  NOTE: THE REASON WHY I AM DOING THIS IS THAT, I WOULD RATHER SEE THE WHOLE AMOUNT GO DIRECTLY TO CHARITY, THAN HAVE THOSE BANK DIRECTORS AND SHARE HOLDERS HAVE IT IN THEIR PERSONAL BANK ACCOUNTS.  IT IS ALSO A LIFE TIME OPPORTUNITY FOR ME AND HOPEFULLY YOU AS WELL.

legitimate,phishing,True,"No Confidence in Congress Lou Dobbs Tonight Thursday, June 21, 2007  Tonight, a new Gallup poll reveals only 14 percent of Americans have confidence in the United States Congress. This poll comes on the heels of several others showing Congressional and Presidential approval ratings at the lowest level in years. What in the world is going on in Washington, and what can we do about it? We'll ask and asnwer those questions tonight.  More than 15 million children are at risk of dropping out of our nations schools, according to the Office of Juvenile Justice Department. With already more than a million students not lining up to graduate this year, there is a new outcry for parental involvement in childrens lives. Studies list parental involvement as key when it comes to combating dropout rates. Well have a full report tonight.  Illegal aliens are now taking extreme measures to cross our southern border, including starting fires near observation towers. The Border Patrol says apprehensions are down, but are these new diversion tactics to blame? We'll have a special report.  Senators Ted Kennedy and Dianne Feinstein held a press conference today touting the importance of a provision for illegal alien agricultural workers in the Senates immigration reform bill.  Meanwhile Senators Jim DeMint, Chuck Grassley and David Vitter are held a press conference discussing why the Senates so-called grand compromise will only repeat the failures of the past. Well report on the battle to get the bill back out on the floor.  And well take a look at the latest developments towards the creation of a North American Union between the United States, Mexico and Canada.  We'll also discuss the Senate's grand compromise on immigration with Senator Claire McCaskill. The Senator says we will never get a handle on illegal immigration until we hold employers accountable.

legitimate,phishing,True,"[Ip-health] Economist: Drugs firms are rethinking their business model  http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9409230  Beyond the blockbuster Drugs firms are rethinking their business model   LIPITOR is a drugs company's dream. The cholesterol pill made by Pfizer, an American pharmaceuticals giant, is the world's best-selling drug. Last year it earned over $13 billion in revenues. Other hugely successful drugs include GlaxoSmithKline's Advair, an asthma remedy, and Plavix, a blood thinner, which is sold by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Sanofi-Aventis. Both enjoy billions of dollars in annual sales. Despite such rewards, however, pharmaceutical companies are reconsidering their pursuit of blockbuster drugs, as new technology permits the creation of niche remedies that target rare ailments or sub-populations of people suffering from common diseases.  That explains the $3 billion hostile takeover bid announced this week by Roche, a Swiss pharmaceutical firm, for Ventana Medical Systems, an American diagnostics firm. This year, Roche has gobbled up several diagnostics and genetic-testing firms making technologies that enhance the value of its targeted cancer therapies. The firm recently completed a $155m takeover of 454 Life Sciences, which makes gene-sequencing technology and last week spent some $273m on NimbleGen, which makes technologies used in identifying the genetic causes of disease.  Roche is being drawn away from conventional one-size-fits-all drugs partly by the allure of the lucrative new markets being created by the development of personalised medicine. But drugs giants are also victims of their own success. Blockbusters like Lipitor are already so effective, argues Tom Nagle of Monitor, a management consultancy, that it is difficult to come up with alternatives that are good enough to command a higher price.  Worse, many blockbusters are going off patent soon and pharmaceutical giants are finding it increasingly difficult to come up with new drugs to replace themdespite throwing pots of money at the problem (see chart). Makers of generic drugs are also growing more assertive in attacking patents. As a result of all this, reckons IMS, an industry consultancy, the industry saw a record $18 billion in branded sales collapse in 2006.  There are signs that long-term investors are growing concerned. A coalition of institutional investors representing over $1.1 trillion in assets, issued a report this month demanding a rethink of core business assumptions. Martin Eijgenhuijsen of ABP, a Dutch pension fund that is part of the coalition, says, We have serious doubts that the current business model can deliver targeted drugs. This requires radical change.  So is the industry ready to follow Roche's lead toward specialty products, targeted therapies and the like? The answer seems to be yes. Ray Hill of IMS calculates that although the vast mainstream market for chronic diseases like high blood pressure or diabetes is still important, specialty drugs accounted for nearly two thirds of total revenue growth last year, up from just a third in 2000. And only a quarter of drugs launched last year tackled chronic diseases, suggesting the pipeline is shifting toward targeted therapies.  For that trend, thank both technology and regulation. Anthony Farino of the consultancy arm of PricewaterhouseCoopers argues that such technologies as high-throughput sequencing, genomics and personal phenotyping, which were not available five years ago, are now transforming how drugs are discovered and tested. Ron Krall, GSK's chief medical officer, thinks the trick is identifying which patients will benefit most from new treatmentsor, equally usefully, which ones will have adverse reactions. To determine that, his firm has just opened a new facility in London run jointly with Imperial College and Hammersmith Hospital, where experimental drugs are tested. The micro-doses they administer to patients are analysed in real time by molecular scanners.  Regulators could play a decisive role in the large drugs companies' shifting strategies. The risk-averse stance they have taken since safety problems led Merck to recall its painkiller, Vioxx, may help propel the industry more rapidly away from blockbusters. Viren Mehta, an industry expert, speculates that although new drugs will always carry unknown risks, the regulatory burden might prove lighter for those aimed at specific, acute conditions (as opposed to ongoing maladies like diabetes). After all, he says, Fewer people are at risk for a shorter time.  Another regulatory boost may come from cost-benefit analysis that considers the long-term benefits, and not just the high price tags, of innovative new drugs. Britain's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has approved Herceptin, a targeted cancer drug, despite an annual cost per patient of nearly $50,000 because, in the words of Sir Michael Rawlins, NICE's chairman, it provides long-term value. NICE has also agreed to buy a cancer treatment made by Johnson & Johnson that has little effect on a third of patients, on the condition that it pay only when the drug works. And with an expensive Alzheimer's drug, the agency ruled that it would not pay for patients with the mildest form of dementia to take ita ruling that was challenged in a London court this week.  Such lawsuits are a sign that the transition to a new way of doing business carries risks. But as Graham Higson, head of regulatory affairs at AstraZeneca, a British drugs firm, notes: There's no such thing as no risk. The industry simply cannot continue developing drugs exactly the same way it has for 40 years. _______________________________________________ Ip-health mailing list Ip-health@lists.essential.org http://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health",0

Tim Kaine talked about Barack's ability to unite our country -- we  haven't asked you to dig into your pockets.  We've asked you to get to know  Barack, to study his positions, to make phone calls to your neighbors, to go  door to door -- to get involved.  But today, I ask you to consider making a contribution as the campaign enters a  new phase. Wisconsin, Texas, Ohio, Pennsylvania -- the next big contests in  this campaign are big media market states, huge states that are expensive to  build statewide field organizations in, and Barack has a lot of ground to make  up. To win, Barack can use all of our help.

I know not everyone here is an Obama supporter, and diversity  of opinion is a strength, not a weakness of our community -- but you've ""had my  back"" in so many fights these last years, I knew I could ask you to consider  signing up for another mission.  I have to tell you, this campaign has me excited. Excited, because I have seen  so much hope out there as I've traveled the country for Barack. Excited,  because as frustrated as I've been that the three words ""George W. Bush""  silenced any conversation at dinner tables around the country the last  eight years, I think we've found three words that will open a conversation  across the old divides, regardless of race, religion, gender, or income level -- and those three words are ""President Barack Obama"".  So please, click here to contribute what you can for Barack's campaign: http://click.email.johnkerry.com/?ju=fe6216757361027d7511&ls=fdf715747c670c7977157370&m=fefd1273716607&l=fecd177070660c7d&s=fe2f167176660674721171&jb=ffcf14&t=   I care about making this happen. I care about seeing Barack Obama win against  John McCain in a way that will break the Republican Roadblock in the Senate and  grow our progressive majority in the Congress.  Please dig deep -- I know we can do this.   This feels like the moment that got me and my generation to care about  politics -- and I want it to be the moment that millions more start to care for  the first time, or to care again, the way that you and I do now.

He actually made a numbered time (fixed)deposit valued at US$112,000,000.00  (One Hundred and Twelve million united states dollars),for twelve calendar  months in my bank.The funds was actually meant for a project our late client wanted to start in the near future (a multi million Dollar steel plant in Canada), I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, I sent a reminder and finally we discovered that Mr.Cosban died from an automobile accident with his entire family .On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a Will, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Cosban did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents,including his Bank Deposit paperwork in our Bank. Upon this discovery, I now seek your permission to have you stand as a next of kin to the deceased as all documentations will be carefully worked out by me for the funds to be released in your favour as the beneficiary's next of kin.

phishing,legitimate,True,"Co-Operation FROM MR. JAMES OPOKU TEL: +233 208216645  Before I introduce myself, I wish to inform you that this letter is not  a hoax mail and I urge you to treat it serious. This letter must come  to you as a big surprise, but I believe it is only a day that people  meet and become great friends and business partners.  My name is Mr. James Opoku, the present branch Manager of a bank here  in Ghana. I write you this proposal in good faith, believing that I can  trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you. Like I  said, I have a transaction that will benefit both of us, as your  assistance is required as a foreigner. I use to head the Accounts  department in my bank head office, but last December I was asked to  take position of a Manager of our branch in Kumasi who passed on, so  that was how I became the present Manager and discovered a fortune. As  I resumed duty, I discovered an account with total sum of $12,500,000  million that has not been operated on for the past 4 years. From my  investigation, I found out that this account belongs to one Late Mr.  Morris Thompson an American great industrialist and a resident of  Alaska, who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of Alaska  Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31 2000, including his  wife and only daughter.  You shall read more news about the crash on visiting this site which I  got during my investigation;    and //www.nativefederation.org/history/people/mThompson.html  The account is escrow call account, a secret type of account in my bank  and no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning  it, the account has no other beneficiary. I have kept a close  monitoring of the account since then and nobody has come forward to ask  about the money as next of kin to the late Mr. Morris Thompson, meaning  that no one is aware of the account.  I cannot directly take out this money without the help of a foreigner  and that is why I am contacting you for an assistance to claim the  funds and share it with me. As the Manager of my bank branch, I have  the power to influence the release of the funds to any foreigner that  comes up as the next of kin to the account, with the correct  information concerning the account, which I shall give you.  I am seeking your co-operation to present you as the next of kin to the  account, so that my bank head quarters will release the funds to you.

legitimate,phishing,True,"RE: DWR and Edison Meetings  Baldwin's traveling--meeting with DWR today.  But he knows we want to meet and knows the days we're talking about--left a message with his secretary.  I suspect that, if DWR is free on either Monday or Tuesday, we'll be meeting.  Followed up with Fielder this morning.  He's at an off-site all day and is supposed to call me back COB today.  He knows we want to meet with Craver and offered to set it up.  If he hasn't got it scheduled when I talk to him, I'll go directly to Craver.  I'll hopefully have things more set in stone by end of today or tomorrow by noon.  That work?

phishing,legitimate,True,"st0ck rum0rs that bec0me true and pr0fitable Bio-Matrix Scientific Gr0up, Inc.  Symbo|: BMXG.PK Industry: Biotechno|ogy; Stem Cel| Techno|ogies. Current Price: .85 Shares Out.: 8.0 Million Est. F|oat: 2.5 Mi|lion  Projected Valuation: 3.5O per share   Bio-Matrix Scientific- Banking on Stem Cel| Research.  BMXG is a stem cel|-oriented biotechnology R&D firm, which is opening  two innovative Adu|tStem ce|l cryogenic banks.  Cryobanks wi|l provide  near-term revenue stream whi|e BMXG develops new and innovative stem  cell technologies and products.   The Stem Cel| Revo|ution:  With breakthroughs in the |ate 1990's, stem cel| research has been one  of the most exciting deve|opments in biotechno|ogy, promising to aid in  the treatment or cure of degenerative and chronic diseases, including  |eukemia, cancer, and diabetes.  Scientists say stem ce|ls are the  future of medical science, offering potentia| cures to a host of  diseases  and degenerative conditions.  Market research firm, visiongain has  estimated that stem cel| products wi|l account for over 1O bil|ion in  annual  sales by 2O13- phenomenal growth for an industry which did not exist  on|y a few years ago.  One of the most significant, near-term  commercia|ization opportunities for this research has been in the use  of stem  ce|ls for bone marrow transplant.  Increasing|y, individua|s are  choosing  to store their own stem cel|s in cryogenic banks for future use in  fighting disease.  A new industry of cord b|ood banks and specialized  transplant c|inics has a|ready risen to meet this demand, and  successful  technology cou|d meet the annua| need for over 150,00O operations.  Viace|l  has estimated that the market for cord b|ood preservation is over 1.2  bi|lion in the US, and 2 bil|ion globa||y.  For our most recent Active Trader's profi|e, we have discovered a smal|  rapidly emerging company that is quick|y becoming a major player in the  stem cel| revolution, Bio-Matrix Scientific.   About the Company: BMXG  Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp., Inc. (OTC Pink Sheets: BMXG) is an  innovative biotechno|ogy R&D company, focused on the commercia|ization  of new  and groundbreaking stem cel| technologies.  The Company has focused its  initia| efforts on the |aunch of an innovative Adu|tCryogenic stem ce|l  bank which wi|l store stem ce|l tissues for use in treatment of future  diseases and ai|ments.  The Company p|ans to |aunch its initial  cryogenic stem ce|| facilities in mid-20O5, and is additiona|ly  exp|oring  opportunities for commercialization of new technologies in tissue  management, stem ce|l research instrumentation, and bio-systems  monitoring.   With impending establishment of an AdultStem cel| cryobank, research  efforts at the forefront of the stem ce|l market, and experienced  management  team, we expect Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp. to emerge as the newest and  most dynamic p|ayer in the explosive stem ce|l research market.   Investment Highlights:  BMXG is exceptionally we|| positioned at the forefront of one of the  most exciting new frontiers in biotech- stem cel| research.  Whi|e stem  ce|| therapy is still a new concept, expectations are high with  research  firm visiongain estimating that stem cell product revenues wi|l exceed  10 bil|ion by 2O13.  Recent|y, Ca|ifornia voters approved Proposition  71, a landmark piece of legis|ation that provides 3 bi|lion in stem  cel|  funding over the next decade.  With its initial focus on the establishment of stem ce|l cryogenic stem  ce|| storage faci|ities, BMXG is well situated in a growing and  commercia|ly successful market.  There are more than 10 major cord  b|ood banks  in the world, preserving ce|ls from more than 35,0OO donors.  Viacel|  has estimated that this market is 1.2 billion in the US and over 2  bi||ion wor|dwide.  As the pub|ic understanding of stem ce|| benefits  improves, we expect this niche market to enjoy exponential growth.  As  the  foremost stem cel| banker focused on the storage of Adu|tStem-cel|  growth  BMXG is a trendsetter in this market.  BMXG is making aggressive entry into the stem cell instrumentation  market with deve|opment of new medical devices specifical|y designed to  facilitate the removal and transp|ant of stem ce||s.  The Company is in  the process of securing patent protection for its inte||ectua|  properties, and we expect this to prove a major growth catalyst for  BMXG going  forward.  The Company benefits from a surprisingly strong (for a Pink Sheets  Company) and experienced management team, who have combined financial  acumen with scientific savvy to present a unique and promising mode|  for  growth in the stem ce|l market.  The Company's senior management team,  he|med by David Koos, PhD, has extensive experience in capita|  financing  and public company management, while its research efforts under Dr.  Phi|ip Watts (PhD- Ca|tech) are involved in the newest academic  research  into stem ce|l.   Investment Conclusion: Projected Va|uation: 3.5O per share  Wa|l Street has been quick to the react to the potential of stem cel|  research and stem cell stocks are outperforming a|l of the major  biotech  indices.  Leading stem cel| research companies such as StemCe|ls, Inc.  (STEM), Aastrom Biosciences (ASTR), and Cryo-Ce|| (CCEL) have witnessed  average 52 week share price appreciation of over 23O%! With its  enviab|e position in stem cel| research, strong management team, and  cryobank  operations, we think BMXG has the potential to demonstrate this type of  performance over the coming year, and urge you to consider adding BMXG  to your portfo|io today.

phishing,legitimate,True,"CONFIDENTIAL  AND  URGENT Hello,  I am writing you this mail today on personal grounds and l implore you to get back to me in earnest. I am interested in doing business with your humble self, but before I proceed further, I want you to please note that this is not a sort of joke, I mean business.  I want to invest heavily in your country and other countries within your geographical zone as you may indicate as ideal. Once you are interested in this proposed joint venture transaction, I will be giving you a breakdown; we will start relating with each.  As you may wish to know, I am the director of P.P.M.C (Petroleum Products Marketing Company); a subsidiary of Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation,CC N.N.P.C. My office is in charge of selling crude oil to foreign companies/countries that come to lift or buy oil as well as registering and certifying each and every one of them before a single barrel is lifted.   As a result of the recent upsurge in the price of crude oil, I and some of my colleague make 30 cent on a barrel and for over the period of 2 months, we had realized US$50 M (FIFTY MILLION US DOLLARS). As civil servants getting this money out of my country (Nigeria) for investment poses a problem, following the fact that Government officials are prohibited from running a foreign account, and as such, I crave your indulgence to assist in this regard, if you wish to assist, kindly mail me back. So we could go in to business. Please Email me your response to my personal box:  (drgodianokocha@myway.com)   As the transaction progress, you stand the chance to negotiate what your cut will be from the US$50 M (FIFTY MILLION US DOLLARS).

phishing,legitimate,True,"YOURS  FAITHFULLY DR.EVERES HENRY AUDDITOR GENERAL  PERSONAL & CONFIDENTIAL  ATTN:  Dear.........,  PROVISION OF BANK ACCOUNT TO DEPOSIT FUNDS""   Please accept my sincere apology if my email does not meet your business or personal ethics. I will first introduce myself as DR.EVERES HENRY, a staff in the audit section of a well-known bank, here in London, England.   One of our accounts, with holding balance of 26,000,000 (Twenty Six Million Pounds Sterling) has been dormant and last operated three years ago. From my investigations and confirmation, the owner of the said account, a foreigner by name John Shumejda died on the 4th of January 2002 in a plane crash in Birmingham; you can view this CNN website: (http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/01/04/england.plane/)for details on the crash. Since then, nobody has done anything as regards the claiming of this money, as he has no family member that has any knowledge as to the existence of either the account or the funds; and also information from the National Immigration also states that he was single on entry into the UK.   After detailed investigations on the deceased and his account, I found out there is no mention of any heirs or family member on the account document in the Bank records, therefore the money was lodged secretly into the account. Plans are to transfer the fund out with your sincerely help. This transaction is totally free of risk and troubles as the fund is legitimate and does not originate from drug, money laundry, terrorism or any other illegal act.  On your interest, let me hear from you URGENTLY. I look forward to hear from you soonest.  May God bless you.  Warm Regards, DR.EVERES HENRY.       __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!? Tired of spam?  Yahoo!

It may be confusing behaviour, but its not a bug. > It works just the same as the equivalent code would work with a hash. --- 	Is referencing a ""hash"" guaranteed to check for references in a parent before returning failure for a non-local definition?  	I don't think it is the same.  Part of OO functionality -- a MAJOR part, is that if the ""method"" is not defined local, they it checks the parent classes. 	The error message tells the user ""&localclass::method"" isn't found in ""$self->parentmethod;"".  The user will think ""I know that.  It is a parent method -- I wouldn't expect it to be in localclass.  Why doesn't it do the standard OO-lookup *before* returning ""undefined"".  If I DID NOT want an OO-call (that checks through parents), I could tell it to call the function as a local function.  Instead of      $self->method I'd use:      method($self).  But using the method-call syntax ""$self->method"", it should look through the parent classes for the method *before* throwing the undefined-error.   > d:\\>perl -e""my $x=\\&foo eval 'sub foo { warn qq(foo) }'; $x->()"" > foo at (eval 1) line 1. >  > d:\\>perl -e""my %f; my $r=\\$f{x}; $$r='testing'; print $f{x};"" > testing >  > The similarity in behavior is not unexpected, given that Perl's global > symbol tables are really just hashes in disguise. ---- 	BUT a hash table isn't something *DEFINED* to look in parent classes.  A method-call is.

Since this produces > undesirable results you simply shouldn't do that.  ---- 	Well this is the solution others come up with -- but no one even knew ""why"" until I reported the bug.  It's confusing and not behaving as the OO-language lookup is supposed to.  > You should do something like >  >    my @dummy; push @dummy,(\\&boom) if defined *boom{CODE};     #ln 22 >  > which takes a reference to the sub only if it is actually defined. ---- 	That is yet ANOTHER great workaround.  That doesn't mean that a call, through a Blessed-ref shouldn't, *FIRST*, do the parental method lookup, before throwing the fatal error.  I would do the parental lookup just before throwing the ""Undefined"" error -- it doesn't have to be ""optimized"" -- just ""work"".  	This is another part that is ""really wrong"".  The user cannot rely on the built-in ""can()"" function to determine if the method is safe to call.  I tried to ""protect"" the calls -- but 'can' returns true if there has been a reference to the same-name, but undefined local function.  You can't use ""defined($self->method)"" as a replacement for $self->can('method');  	I acknowledge that this is not as str8tforward a fix as one might like, but I believe this area is hit more often than the bug report numbers represent.  Too many perl-experts knew the workaround, but couldn't say WHY what I was doing failed.  Narrowing down to the point where I could get others to understand the bug and to where felt I had a handle on it well enough to *report the bug*, took a bit of persistence.  I'd guess most people wouldn't bother to find the ""root cause"" let along get it to the point of filing it in a bug.",0

This is not so much ""clear"" as ""completely different"", but yes, that is the principle meaning of the word ""materials"" and the ony logical reason why the author would've used the term here.  A court is going to consider what the apparent intent was -- not try to stretch the meaning beyond the obvious.  > Would you expect an art *materials* catalogue to...  Hereafter, you are trying to stretch the meaning to something that it obviously wasn't intended to mean.  You can do that, because the license is POORLY WRITTEN. Which I have already said. Miraculously, you and I appear to AGREE on that point.  One consequence of this is that some lawyer might try to play the same games with the language that you are doing here.  I think the court would laugh in his face, but who knows?  > I'm trying to understand how it is possible to claim that compilers > don't fit the meaning of materials there  That would be by using the *normal*, *first* definition of ""materials"" and not some alternate meaning that has come about by association.  There is also the point that it wouldn't make any sense to require the meaning you are attempting to press: is there even a compiler which can be ""released in source format under conditions of this license""? If not, then it stands to reason that the author, knowing this, cannot have intended to limit compilation to such a hypothetical compiler. This is yet more evidence for an intent which agrees with the obvious interpretation of the language.  So, are you saying you honestly believe the author's intent was to block compilation of changes to his package altogether? If so, why distribute source at all? Furthermore, you believe that having this irrational intent, he then tried to hide it by using a word which *might* be interpreted to support his intent, but whose most obvious meaning contradicts it?  I find that a pretty implausible theory.  Your interpretation is distorts the license's original intent by using alternate meanings of words. As such it may even be semantically correct (that is, it may be within the set of possible semantic meanings of the utterance), but it is pragmatically incorrect (it is not the subset of that set that was meant by the author -- as we can tell from context). Intent is a matter of pragmatics[1] -- the study of situated utterances as evidence for meaning, not semantics[2] -- the study of isolated utterances for potential meaning.  You're pounding very hard on the semantics, trying to broaden the set of possible meanings, and you're not wrong about that as far as you go, but that's missing the point. The question was not ""what could this sentence possibly mean"", but ""what did this sentence mean when the author wrote it"" -- which is what actually matters legally.  The rest of the license, the fact of using the license, the fact of releasing software with source code and the consequences of licensing choices all provide situational information which supports the pragmatic interpretation of the sentence in question.  The fact that courts (or we) have to go beyond semantics to understand the license is a serious flaw of the license, which I've already pointed out, but as evidence of the author's actual intent, I think it is sufficient.

phishing,legitimate,True,"for assistant Dear Sir, I am Alhaji Mohammed Abacha, the son of the late Nigerian Head of State who died on the 8th of June 1998 while in active services. Following the sudden death of my father, General Sani Abacha, the present Civilian Government has thrown my family and I into a state of utter confusion,  frustration,and hopelessness.  I have been subjected to inhuman physical and physiological torture, incarceration by the security Agents in my country. I was only recently released from detention after been arraigned before the Federal High Court of Nigeria for an offence committed by my late father. The incumbent civilian administration of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo has intensified his probe into my late father's activities while in the office and he has frozen all our local and foreign accounts together with  other assets of my family as a retaliation for what my late father did to him when he was alive as the Head of the Military regime in Nigeria.  As a matter of fact, we have been declared bankrupt and they are not relenting to make us poor for life.As a man that is so traumatized, I have lost confidence with anybody within my country as all those who benefited immensely during the regime of my late father have openly abandoned all my family.   MY REASONS FOR CONTACTING YOU. I got your contacts through my personal research and out of desperation decided to reach you through this medium.   You must have heard over the media reports and the Internet on the recovery of various huge sums of money deposited by my late father in different Banks and security firms abroad.  Some of these banks and security firms willingly gave-up/divulge their banking secrets and disclosed to the present civilian administration of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, all my family's cash lodgement and monetary transactions with them.Please my dear, I repose great confidence in you and I hope you will not betray my confidence in you.   I have secretly deposited the sum of $20,000,000.00 with a security firm abroad whose name is withheld for now until we open communications. The money is contained in a metal box consignment with Security Deposit Number.I shall be grateful if you could receive this fund into your Bank account for safekeeping.  This arrangement is known to you and my junior brother (Abbas) only. So I will deal directly with you. I am proposing a 20% share of the fund to you for your kind assistance. I shall provide for you all the documents of the fund deposit with the security firm, and raise a power of attorney `to enable you claim and receive this fund into your bank account. Also this transaction demands absolute disclose it to anybody  irrespective of your relation with the person.  Remember, loose lips sinks ship I am looking forward to your urgent and positive response via my email =. abacha2@webmail.co.za.  Best regards Alhaji Mohammed Abacha.",1

Dear Friend,  I am delighted to write this letter to you hoping that you will understand my predicament and answer back without hesitation.  I am Dr Maryam Abacha the wife of the late Nigerian head of State General Sani Abacha.

I am in possession of $25 000.000 (TWENTY FIVE MILLION U.S DOLLARS ONLY) which I want to invest in your country. For your clarification and understanding,this money in a box which my husband deposited in the finance and security company in dis-guise as a family treasure since 11th of febuary 1998, is not an ill gotten wealth rather, it was generated from my organisation FAMILY SUPPORT PROGRAM (F.S.P). I will enlighten you more of this organisation if you indicate a helping interest to secure this money on my behalf.  On your acceptance to render this assistance to me,I will instruct the finance company to effect a change of ownership of this fund in your name as the bona-fide owner to enable you claim the fund from the security and finance company,also I will disclose to you the country and the name of the finance and security company where this money is being deposited.  What I demand from you now is to arrange for a visit to the finance company where this money is being deposited and claim it as the bona-fide owner.It is very ideal you forward to me your private telephone and fax numbers to enable me send all relevant documents pertaining the deposit of this fund for your clarification and more understanding.  Bear in mind that this transaction demands absolute confidentiality because properties and bank accounts both local and international bearing the Abacha's family name, are being ordered to be confiscated by the newly elected civilian President of Nigeria (President Olusegun Obasanjo) hence I will not want to be exposed.  Let me refer you to the front page of This Day Newspapers of 10th March 2001. You can check it through their website:www.thisdayonline.com , click on archives,8th.june,2001) The present government in Nigeria had frozen and seized all my bank accounts both here in Nigeria and abroad.

When you must have taken the agreed percentage, you will use part of the balance to buy a living house for my family there in your country, where we shall live in the future and the remaining part will be kept for investment package also in your country which will be under your supervision.  Contact me through my son (OMAR ABACHA) who recently escaped from Nigeria to Johannesboug South Africa where he is now staying as a refuge on his email address omarabacha@hotmail.com to avoid us losing this money, since it is the only remaining fund for the survival of my family.

phishing,legitimate,True,"KINDLY ASSIST URGENT RESPONSE  Hi Friend, In recent times over the radio in AMERICA or even in ASIA you must have heard about my family regarding huge sums of money stacked in foreign banks in different names for business. I believe, is a legacy we came to meet, when my late Husband became the head of state. It does not matter whether you are small or big but your ability to help me sort out things is mostly needed now. I do not justify myself but it has happened, so i need you to help me and my family survive in life.Thus it is with hope that I write to  seek your help in the context below.  I am Hajia Mariam Abacha, wife of Nigeria's former head of state; Late General Sani Abacha, whose sudden death occurred on the 8th of June 1998.  Since my husband died, I have been thrown into a state of utter confusion, frustration and hopelessness by the present civilian administration.  The security agents in the country have subjected me to physical and psychological torture. My son (Mohammed Abacha) is still under detention arraigned before the federal high court of Nigeria for an offence he did not commit. As a widow that has been traumatized, I am hopeless with my present faith. You must have heard over the media reports on the recovery of various sums of money deposited by  my late husband with various security firms. Some companies willingly gave up their secret and disclosed  our money confidently lodged there, or many, outright blackmail. Infact the total sum discovered by the government so far is in the tune of $700 to $600 Million USD and they are not relenting to make me poor for life.   I came in contact with your name and address through my personal research and would want to have faith and confidence in you as I view you to be of responsible personality. I have no doubt about your capacity and goodwill to assist me in receiving into your custody (for safety) the sum of $70.3 Million USD willed and deposited safely in my favour by my late husband. This money  is currently kept in Safe Deposit Box (SDB) at a security firm within Europe.  As it is legally required, the administration of my late husband's property is under the authority of the family's Lawyer(Attorney).  The investigative teams set up by my government have submitted their report after freezing almost all our account.Fortunately, our family lawyer had secretly protected the personal will of my husband from the notice of the investigators and have strictly advised that the$70.3m USD be urgently moved to an overseas account of any trust worthy but ANNONYMOUS foreign family   friend without delay, for security reasons.All our traveling papers have been seized by the government thereby preventing us from traveling and all the local and international outfit of our business empire seized.  This sum of money is our only hope to stay alive. I have therefore agreed to compensate your good self with 30% of the total deposit only when you recieve the deposit box from the security firm and its contents safely lodged in your account. They have equally guaranteed 100% risk-free and smooth transfer. If you are interested in assisting me, please reach me immediately and send to me your confidential telephone and fax number(s) so that I or my son mustapha can reach you as soon as possible.   For obvious security reasons, it is imperative that you  keep all our communication very secret. Do not mention my family`s name or disclose the transaction to anybody. If you are not interested in assisting me, please still get in touch so that I can make alternative arrangement as time is of the essence.Please do not expose me to my government.

I  inherited a total sum of $21.5 Million American dollars from my late  husband, the money was concealed in a metallic trunk box and was  deposited with a security company in Abidjan Cote D' Ivoire, in  secretly  safe keeping in the trunk box that was because I needed a  maximum security/safety of my consignment and no body know about it  even the government organization can  naver trace  where about of the  money until I am ready and prepare to claim it. but the Secuerity  company didn't know the real content of the box, because it was  deposited as a family valuables.  My main purpose of sending you this mail is because of the way I found  you and perhaps trustworthy to give you this priority of shipping the  trunk box to any address that you think is very secure and save in your  country for onward lodgement in your account for the purpose of future  investment with your percentage of which we shall talk of it. I will  send you the Authorization Certificate to call them in my next mail  which is the Certificate of deposit that they gave me on the very day  when the box of money was deposited under their security company. I  give thanks immensely for your co-operation as I look forward to hear  from you for quick conclusion of this transaction.The percentage will  be your reward for all your moral and financial assistance during the  period of moving the trunk box to your country.You are therefore  requested to furnish me through my e-mail address You reply to my  pravite email ( al_20099@yahoo.fr )  Thanks and I look forward to your urgent message.

Now, in the continuing economic    downturn,  foreign  workers  are  being  blamed  for  displacing their    homegrown counterparts.     Wednesday,  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., will introduce a bill crafted    to  close  loopholes  in  employment  visa  laws,  which he says allow    companies  to  hire  foreign  employees  and  outsource  them to other    companies.     ADVERTISEMENT     IFRAME:    http://ad.doubleclick.net/adi/eweek.dart/news;sz=336x280;ord=456641793    3?    [news;abr=!ie;sz=336x280;ord=4566417933?]      [ew_spacer.gif]     ""We must make sure that our immigration policies don't have a backlash    effect  on displacing American workers,"" Chambliss said Tuesday. ""[The    bill]  will  end the practice of companies who are displacing American    workers.""     The  Senate  Judiciary  Committee  Tuesday  took a look at the role of    temporary work visas in the current economy. The technology industry's    use  of  H-1B  visas  dropped approximately 75 percent last year, with    initial  H-1B visa applications falling to 26,659 in 2002 from 105,692    in  2001,  according  to the Department of Homeland Security Office of    Immigration Security.     Despite  the  statistics,  as unemployment rises in the United States,    lawmakers are hearing from their constituents.     ""I  cannot  tell  you  how  many  workers  came up to me [in August in    California]  and  said, 'I've been replaced by somebody I trained, and    they're  getting  a  third  [the  salary] of what I got,'"" Sen. Dianne    Feinstein,  D-Calif.,  said  at  a  hearing  of  the  Senate Judiciary    Committee  Tuesday. ""Wherever I go, this program comes up and somebody    tells me they've been replaced, and they are angry.""     Intel  Corp.,  which  employs close to 80,000 workers worldwide, hires    individuals  through  the  H1-B  visa program when a position requires    unique  or  difficult-to-find  skills,  Patrick Duffy, human resources    attorney  at Intel, told lawmakers. Beginning in 2001, Intel decreased    hiring  overall,  but  it  continues  to  hire H-1B applicants when it    cannot  find  qualified  U.S.  workers,  Duffy  said.  The company has    particular difficulty hiring U.S. citizens for positions in electrical    engineering design and chemical engineering, he said.     Duffy  contended  that  the  H-1B  visa program does not displace U.S.    workers  and  ultimately  benefits  the  U.S.  economy.  Most  of  the    company's  H-1B visa employees studied at U.S. universities and earned    masters degrees and doctorates.     ""These are not temporary workers to us. The H-1B visa is just one step    in  making these workers U.S. workers,"" Duffy said. ""Hopefully they'll    stay with Intel ... the rest of their lives.""     Large  corporations  that  rely  on skilled foreign workers are urging    Congress  not  to pass short-term fixes that will later cause problems    when  the  economy  recovers.  In  the  boom  times  of the late '90s,    Ingersoll-Rand  Corp. had to take people off the payroll when the H-1B    hiring  cap  was  lowered,  Elizabeth Dickson, adviser for Immigration    Services  at  Ingersoll-Rand  in  Woodcliff Lake, N.J., told lawmakers    Tuesday.     ""When  the [foreign worker hiring] cap reverts to 65,000, we are going    to  have a lot of problems that we experienced both in 1997 and 1998,""    Dickson  said.  ""If  we  have a recovering economy, what are our needs    going to be long term?""     The  root of the problem, according to the industry officials, is that    Americans  earn too few graduate degrees in the hard sciences, leaving    the  domestic  pool of adequate engineering specializations too small.    Contrary  to some assertions, industry officials said they do not hire    foreign  workers  to  pay  them  less  than  they would pay Americans.    Dickson  told  lawmakers  that  it  is  more expensive to hire foreign    workers.     ""We  are  mostly  looking  to  hire U.S. workers. They're cheaper, and    there  are  a  lot  less problems,"" Dickson said. ""In the near term we    simply must have access to foreign nationals.

This is not so much ""clear"" as ""completely different"", but yes, that is the principle meaning of the word ""materials"" and the ony logical reason why the author would've used the term here.  A court is going to consider what the apparent intent was -- not try to stretch the meaning beyond the obvious.  > Would you expect an art *materials* catalogue to...  Hereafter, you are trying to stretch the meaning to something that it obviously wasn't intended to mean.  You can do that, because the license is POORLY WRITTEN. Which I have already said. Miraculously, you and I appear to AGREE on that point.  One consequence of this is that some lawyer might try to play the same games with the language that you are doing here.  I think the court would laugh in his face, but who knows?  > I'm trying to understand how it is possible to claim that compilers > don't fit the meaning of materials there  That would be by using the *normal*, *first* definition of ""materials"" and not some alternate meaning that has come about by association.  There is also the point that it wouldn't make any sense to require the meaning you are attempting to press: is there even a compiler which can be ""released in source format under conditions of this license""? If not, then it stands to reason that the author, knowing this, cannot have intended to limit compilation to such a hypothetical compiler. This is yet more evidence for an intent which agrees with the obvious interpretation of the language.  So, are you saying you honestly believe the author's intent was to block compilation of changes to his package altogether? If so, why distribute source at all? Furthermore, you believe that having this irrational intent, he then tried to hide it by using a word which *might* be interpreted to support his intent, but whose most obvious meaning contradicts it?  I find that a pretty implausible theory.  Your interpretation is distorts the license's original intent by using alternate meanings of words. As such it may even be semantically correct (that is, it may be within the set of possible semantic meanings of the utterance), but it is pragmatically incorrect (it is not the subset of that set that was meant by the author -- as we can tell from context). Intent is a matter of pragmatics[1] -- the study of situated utterances as evidence for meaning, not semantics[2] -- the study of isolated utterances for potential meaning.  You're pounding very hard on the semantics, trying to broaden the set of possible meanings, and you're not wrong about that as far as you go, but that's missing the point. The question was not ""what could this sentence possibly mean"", but ""what did this sentence mean when the author wrote it"" -- which is what actually matters legally.  The rest of the license, the fact of using the license, the fact of releasing software with source code and the consequences of licensing choices all provide situational information which supports the pragmatic interpretation of the sentence in question.  The fact that courts (or we) have to go beyond semantics to understand the license is a serious flaw of the license, which I've already pointed out, but as evidence of the author's actual intent, I think it is sufficient.

( i wonder what the printer though when i had him print 46 , 000 copies of the recipes in one week ! ) needless to say , i immediately quit my job , paid off al my debts in full and started another mailing . to date my revenues are approaching $ 1 , 000 , 000 . 00 in cold hard cash . believe me , you can do the same thing . this is you lucky break that you have been hoping for all your life . you can make your dreams come true . . . do not pass it up ! the most difficult part was finding a good company to provide responsive names . after trying many name sources , i ran across two companies that provided the best names for this program . their addresses and prices are below : mjg advertising 200 names $ 24 . 00 p . o . box 3009 500 names $ 35 . 00 maple glen , pa 19002 1000 names $ 50 . 00 ( 215 ) 643-1328 2000 names $ 75 . 00 ( 800 ) 880-8143 marnico lists 200 names $ 20 . 00 p . o . box 2046 500 names $ 35 . 00 abington , ma 02351 1000 names $ 60 . 00 request # 3001 2000 names $ 95 . 00 making your fortune is as easy as following these six steps : 1 . send a self addressed stamped envelope and $ 2 . 00 cash wrapped in a sheet of paper specifying which recipe you are ordering by number , to addresses # 1 through # 5 at the end of this bulletin . 2 . order at least 200 names and addresses on labels from the companies mentioned earlier . 3 . while waiting for your labels to arrive , remove the name at the # 1 spot and move each of the names up one position . place your name and address in spot # 5 . move only the names and addresses - not the recipes . this can best be done by retyping the set and pasting the new over the original . 4 . have a local printshop print at least 200 copies of this bulletin . 5 . fold the printed bulletins and place in envelopes , seal and stamp them . 6 . when the labels arrive , place one on each envelope and mail them . now here s the best part - the money you can make ! here is what happens when only 10 % of the people respond to your mailing . you send out at least 200 with your name in position # 5 . 20 people send out at least 200 with your name in position # 4 . 400 people send out at least 200 with your name in position # 3 . 8000 people send out at least 200 with your name in position # 2 . 160000 people send out at least 200 with your name in position # 1 . 168420 x $ 2 . 00 each = $ 336840 in about 60 to 90 days ! ! ! of course you are not limited to mailing only 200 bulletins , or to just one mailing . send out more than 250 or do repeat mailings and you will drastically increase your earnings . when you receive 1 , 000 requests for recipe # 3 , sit back and relax knowing that you re soon going to be a very rich person . yes , this is a perfectly legal mail order marketing plan . if you are in doubt , then refer to title 18 , section 1302 and 1341 of the u . s . postal and lottery laws . a product or service must be exchanged for the money received ; in this case , the product is the recipes . this plan also takes honest work , but the rewards are tremendous . keep a careful account of all money you received and money you spend for income tax purposes . there you have it ! the secret to making thousands for yourself . read this bulletin carefully and then reread it again . think about it , do the math and consider the wealth potential this holds for you . then send $ 2 . 00 cash and a self-addressed stamped envelope today to the addresses in positions # 1 below . go for it , order those recipes today . 1 . chocolate cream pie 2 . pineapple bavarian pudding henry w . frye , sr . harold lookwood 24684 atwood ave . 123 skokorat st . moreno valley , ca 92553 seymour , ct . 06483 3 . chocolate walnut cookies 4 . cheese garlic biscuits vincent myers , jr . dlh enterprises inc . 848 n . rainbow , # 351 p . o . box 5854 las vegas , nv 89107 san jose , ca 95150 5 . magic cookies bar acw enterprises p . o . box 3004-332 corvallis , or 97333 i tried a similar program in which the cost was $ 5 . 00 . in that one , the response was only about 3 % . the first time i sent out this recipe program a got my first responses in just one week . i sent out 250 letters instead of just 100 so my percentage of gains was higher . i am trying again with 500 letters to see if i can surpass the $ 141 , 236 . 00 of the last time . good luck to all of you . it really works ! ! ! sally freisch , st louis , il",1

When you are in the new environment your O:\\drive will contain some UBSWE data AND it will contain a directory named M:\\Estate and O:\\estate which contains links back to all of your M:\\and O:\\ drive data through the M:\\ and O:\\ Drive folders When you are in the new environment your P:\\ drive (new local common directory) will contain some USBWE data AND it will contain a directory named P:\\Estate which contains a link back to all of your legacy local common (i:\\ drive for Calgary users) data through the designated folders. When you are in the new environment you WILL have access to the applications that you use but these are UBSWE, but  you WILL NOT have access back to the Estate applications.  	 If you need access to the Estate applications, please contact your local IT support. They will have an ""est_"" account, with your legacy access rights. Please keep in mind that your ""est_"" account will only be valid until UBSWE Day 1, and you will have to request an extension of these rights should you need them beyond that date.

In view of this I want to acted very fast to withdraw this money from one of  our finance houses before it will be closed down.My husband deposited the  money in a finance firm for safe keeping . No record is known about this  fund by the government because there is no documentation showing that we  have such funds.  Further more, my elder son have been in detention in the last four years  following the death of my late husband for charges of State organized murder  and corrupt practices. he was just been released by the Supreme Court after  the president brokered a deal with my family regarding his freedom. and he  is still under interrogation about my late husband's assets and some vital  documents.  Due to the current situation in the country and government attitude to my  family,I cannot make use of this money within, thus I seek your help in  transferring this funds out for investment than leaving the fund here and to  invest the money to profit my family Bearing in mind that you may assist  me.l have decided to part with 25% of the total sum.

However, weak market fundamentals, including a sluggish economy and increased  US and Canadian supplies, will mitigate the usual winter price rise. CERA  expects an average Henry Hub price of $2.35 in November.  *  Although inventories are close to record levels, storage pressures are  increasingly unlikely to drive cash markets down significantly this year.   *  Gas demand will average 14 percent lower than a year earlier; residential  and commercial sectors show a decline with a return to normal weather, while a  weak economy offsets the return of ammonia and dual-fuel loads in the  industrial sector.  *  Regional storage inventories and weak regional demand should keep upward  pressure off of regional differentials.

legitimate,phishing,True,"RE: Enron's Advocacy in California Jim, We can talk at greater length if you want, but the quick answers to your questions are: 1. PX Credit: Make it simple and transparent.  Best outcome would be no credit -- DA pays T&D costs only, as they appear in the tariff.  Period, end of story. 2. The UDC Financial Hole: The more relief we can get from these items, the better.  Duh.  The small surcharge ($10) is currently factored into in our curves, so the hope is that whatever ultimately emerges from the sausage factory, the ultimate amount that they try to stick on DA customers is < $10.

While games programs have been engineered for efficiency from the early days, high-performance planners are a relatively recent development.  Both planning and games are important fields of research in the Artificial Intelligence community. A trend in the computer game community, exemplified in initiatives such as the General Game Playing Project and ORTS, has been on playing whole classes of games, and on increasing realism and complexity. This tests the limits of traditional game-tree search approaches. However, the planning community has a lot of experience in dealing with huge search spaces. Furthermore, such games also involve current topics of much current interest in planning, such as: time reasoning, resource management, imperfect information, cost-based planning, etc.  This workshop will discuss all aspects of using planning in the domain of games. Relevant topics include, but are not limited to:  - planning techniques for classical games - planning in commercial computer games - integration of planning and game tree search - representational issues: languages for planning in games - opportunities for technology transfer between the communities - competitions - planning stories and scenarios - planning and interactive narrative - integrating planning and affective systems - planning for NPCs - dialogue planning - reasoning about actions and game playing - plan recognition - learning plans  Important Dates: ================  Submission Deadline (extended):    June 25, 2007    11:59pm PST (Samoa time UTC-11)  Notifications and Technical Program:    July 13, 2007  Camera-Ready Paper Submissions:    July 31, 2007  Workshop Date:    September 23, 2007  Submission Procedure: =====================  We ask authors to submit technical papers in PDF format. Papers should be formatted in accordance with the AAAI style template and may be at most 8 pages long, including figures and bibliography. Visit the url http://www.aaai.org/Publications/Author/author.php for formatting instructions. Please submit papers via email to ombquvcukfr-kn6862@lab.inf.uc3m.es  Please note that all submitted papers will be carefully peer-reviewed by multiple reviewers, and that low-quality or off-topic papers will not be accepted.

""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stret! ch! . Trent Dilfer , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point. Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 10/23/01 Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck fr! om! a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week. Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 10/23/01 The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams. Dedric Ward , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season. Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Neal/McKay Updated 10/23/01 Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week. Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week. Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Tori U! pd! ated 10/23/01 Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use him this week. Terrence Wilkins , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week. Terrell Davis , RB DEN - JWillie Updated 10/23/01 Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they will activate h! im! . He will work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Martin Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice until late in the week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota.  Duce Staley , RB PHI - Giggles Updated 10/23/01 Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on 11 carries l! at! e in the game. At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a solid replacement.  Joe Nedney , K TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week.  Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Kinney will be listed on the injury report because of a calf injury. However, he is expected to play in this week's game.  Kevin Dyson , WR TEN - Bass/Hull Updated 10/23/01 Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice. Eddie George , RB TEN - Tori Updated 10/23/01 George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in this week's game.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Martin Updated 10/23/01 McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game.  Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence.  Damon Jones , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery.  Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Martin Updated 10/23/01 Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's game remains uncertain. ""All I know is that, from week to week, they increase his exercises and change of direction,"" head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. ""It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week."" Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23.  Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to action next week.  Todd Heap , TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle.  Terry Allen , RB BAL - Tori Updated 10/23/01 Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at running back if Allen is inactive.  Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Tori Updated 10/23/01 Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. ""I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest area,"" Grbac said Monday. ""There could be something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see."" Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unable to play.  Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Neal/McKay Updated 10/23/01 Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orleans.  Trung Canidate , RB STL - Giggles Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. ""I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game,"" coach Mike Martz said. ""He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play."" Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week.  J.J. Stokes , WR SF - Matty Updated 10/23/01 Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close to being completely healthy. ""Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was a blessing for me because I was ab! le! to get treatment every day,"" Stokes told the Contra Costa Times . ""I practiced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close."" Stokes has been less than mediocre, however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to be more reliable.  Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - Russell Updated 10/23/01 Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants' starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed.  Ron Dixon , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day.  Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Matty Updated 10/23/01 According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. ""I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago,"" Martz said. ""I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play."" Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to go.

legitimate,phishing,True,"Bike Diary #6 Day 13 Date: Thursday July 5, 2001 Distance: 85 miles Moving average speed: 13.1 mph Left at: 8:00 AM Arrived at: 4:00 PM Overnight in: cyclist shelter in Monroeville, IN Latitude 40 d 58 m 7 s N Longitude 84 d 51 m 55 s W Cumulative distance: 1058 miles  Today I passed two major milestones: I crossed another state border (Ohio to Indiana, and yes, I took that picture of the sign), and I logged my 1000th mile.  Now it's easy to extrapolate forward: if I covered 1000 miles in 13 days then I should cover 4000 miles in 52 days, which is 7 weeks and 3 days, within the range of my 6-to-8 week predeparture prediction.  52 days from my starting date (June 23) is August 13.  I would estimate the error on that prediction to be +/- 4 days, on the grounds that I added 1 day of riding to the first 1000 miles to nurse an injured knee, which extrapolates to 4 days over 4000 miles.  The weather today was fine, sunny with a high in the 70s, and the riding conditions would have been perfect were it not for the damn headwind.  It was from the northwest this time, so I could get a  little component of it behind me every time my route turned a little bit south.  But along the stretches of roads aligned due west it was a real grind.  I should digress on the subject of that headwind.  If I could have a nickel for every time somebody has told me that I am riding the ""wrong way"" across the country because the prevailing winds blow from west to east, then I would start getting invited to Bill Gates' parties.  Generally speaking, my interlocutors do not even appreciate the full difficulty of riding from east to west, because not only are the prevailing winds against you, but so are the prevailing hills.  You may recall from a previous Bike Diary entry my discussion of why it is that one should always prefer to go gradually down hill as opposed to an exhilerating rapid descent that squanders all the energy gained from climbing into wind resistance (this is not my opinion, it is a fact of physics).  Well, if you think about it, Denver is a mile high (5000 feet above sea level), but still east of the Front Range of the Rockies.  The Mississippi River, on the other hand, is only a few hundred feet above sea level.  This is true everywhere as you approach the Rockies from the east (for example, Cut Bank, MT on my route is just short of 4000 feet elevation).  Therefore, going west across the great plains you are gradually climbing, only to rapidly descend again when you get across the continental divide. The eastbounders, on the other hand, get the benefit of playing out their altitude gain gradually over a long distance as they descend across the great plains.  So, why go west?  Personally, I feel that flying to the west coast and bicycling back is the moral equivalent of getting air lifted to the top of Everest, skiing down to the base camp and then claiming to have climbed the mountain.  It is as if you wanted the bragging rights to say you rode your bicycle across the country, but you wanted to obtain them with the least amount of exertion necessary.  If you live on the east coast, and you want to ride across the continent, it seems perfectly obvious to me that what you need to do is ride west.  One should not undertake such a project as this if you want to do something easy.  OK, end of tirade.  Just remember this the next time you meet someone who claims to have bicycled across the country: the westbounders are the real cyclists.  Speaking of westbounders, I may be closing in on some ahead of me. I stopped in at the bicycle store in Defiance, OH to see if they had any news of westbounders.  Apparently a couple, short in stature, had passed through four days ago.  I wonder if this is the same couple making a perimeter tour that I heard about from the scruffy eastbounder on route 20 in upstate NY (see Day 4, Bike Diary #2).  If so, they were 8-9 days ahead of me then and are only 4 days ahead of me now, so I may be closing the gap.  In 10 days I've gained 4 on them, with 4 more to go, so I would guess that I will probably catch up to them in another 10 days, around July 15.  Stay tuned.  I'm spending tonight in Monroeville, IN.  Monroeville is like the set of a Frank Capra movie: you have your supper in the Village Cafe (two fried pork chops with mashed potatoes and gravy and a side salad for six bucks) and a chocolate malted from the Whippy Dip for dessert. The clientele of the Whippy Dip is a small crowd of flirting teenagers, there's a little league baseball game going on the playing field in the city park, and after dark the fireflies come out in swarms. You may have thought that places like this didn't exist any more, but here in middle America civil small town life is alive and well. You don't lock up your bike and you don't worry about it, either.  My accomodation here in Monroeville is a pavillion in the city park that has been set up as a shelter specifically for long distance touring cyclists.  There's a small bathroom with every imaginable amenity from warm shower to washer/dryer for your laundry.  The hospitable residents of Monroeville expect nothing in return: you can leave a donation but there's no obligation.  There's a guest book where you can leave your name, starting point and destination, and from the list of names it appears that Monroeville is a popular destination for touring cyclists: there's a few coming through every couple of days. I scanned the list for evidence of westbounders ahead of me to no avail.  Day 14 Date: Friday July 6, 2001 Distance: 83 miles Moving average speed: 14.1 mph Left at 7:30 AM Arrived at 2:30 PM Overnight in Salamonie River State Forest near Wabash, IN Latitude 40 d 48 m 42 s N Longitude 85 d 41 m 53 s W Cumulative distance: 1141  Although I rode 83 miles today, I only advanced 56 along the route to Seattle.  There were two reasons for the extra 27 miles today, the first was an inadvertent detour first thing in the morning when I left Monroeville headed in the wrong direction.  Here's and important fact for you future trans-America cyclists to remember: the sun rises in the east and sets in the west.  Therefore, if you are navigating the midwestern grid on a sunny morning thinking that you are going west but you do not see your shadow in front of you, then something is terribly wrong. It took me about three or four miles to notice this discrepancy, miles which I had to double back, of course.  The second detour was up to Fort Wayne to pick up some mail that my friends Maria and Kate sent me (thanks Kate! thanks Maria!).  I love mail.  The rest of the day was full of county roads and cornfields in Indiana. The wind more or less behaved itself today, starting the morning from the southeast before settling back into its usual pattern of coming from the southwest.  It wasn't much of a wind in either direction, maybe 5-10 mph.  I could easily have made it a longer day, but there is a real scarcity of services along this particular stretch of the route.  The next campground is 38 miles farther on, and there isn't a motel in the next 87 miles.  I probably could have managed the 38 miles to the next campground, but in deference to my still aching knees I quit much earlier in the afternoon than I would normally.  It looks like I made an impressively early start today, but that turns out to be a bit of a trick.  Although most of Indiana is in the eastern time zone, the state does not observe daylight savings time (except for the part in the cental time zone, just for maximum confusion) so at this time of year I crossed into the central time zone for all practical purposes when I crossed the Indiana border.  My campground tonight is a ""primitive facility"" which translates to no shower and pit toilets.  Generally speaking, I don't much mind primitive campgrounds as they are generally alot emptier than the ones that cater to the RV crowd and provide full hookups (water and electrical).  This one is an exception to that rule: there's hardly a vacant site.  I suppose it must be because of the holiday weekend since there isn't anything terribly exciting to do in the neighborhood. Most of the other campers are sitting in their sites experimenting  with all the noise-making gear they have brought along (firecrackers, car stereos, bongo drums, you name it).  Oh well, after all these days on the road I think I could sleep through anything.  Day 15 Date: Saturday July 7, 2001 Distance: 86 miles Moving average speed: 12.1 mph Left at 9:30 AM Arrived at 6:15 PM Overnight in White House B&B in Rensselaer, IN Latitude 40 d 55 m 52 s N Longitude 87 d 9 m 6 s W Cumulative distance: 1227 miles  I awoke this morning at 5 AM (EST) to the sound of distant thunder.  At first, I didn't realize that it was thunder I was hearing.  I'm accustomed to thunder as an intermitent booming; the sound I hear this morning was a continuous background.  After I had ruled out military aircraft on manueovers as a possible source for the sound I heard, I realized that I was in big trouble.  My immediate thought was ""strike the tent and seek shelter"".  That probably seems strange to alot of people who figure that the tent IS shelter, but you may recall from my first night's experience that if the tent is pitched on a slope, then it provides precious little shelter from runoff soaking through the floor of the tent.  I had once again pitched the tent on a slope, not expecting rain.  In fact, it seemed that most of the folks in the campground were not expecting (or at least prepared for) the rain that came.  By 6 AM I had my gear stowed my gear and loaded on the bicycle, and I moved myself and the bicycle to the only shelter on the campground: a pavillion that protected, ironically enough, the campground's water supply. The water supply itself was nothing but a spigot, but it spilled into a catch basin that looked like it came out of a coroner's office: it was a shallow sink no wider than usual but long enough to lay down in.  The pavillion overhangs this sink by three or four feet on any side, therefore the entire sheltered area was no bigger than about eight by ten feet.  At 6:10 AM the rains came with a vengance.  I cannot remember the last time I saw such torrential rain and so much lightning.  I believe that more than four inches of rain fell during the next three and a half hours, with lightning hitting very close to where I was standing.  I now could under- stand why the distant thunder had been continuous, because I was now standing in the middle of it.  And there I stood, for about three and a half hours, making light conversation with some of the other campers who dared step out in the storm and waiting for it to end.  One guy seemed to have an unnaturally detailed knowledge of the roads and motels of Indiana; when I asked him what line of work he was in he said he was following power lines.  Apparently utilities hire these guys to go around the state following the power lines to make sure there are no trees nearby that threaten to fall on them.  At 9:30 AM it was clear that the worst of the storm had passed and I decided to head out and make the most of what was left of the day. I'm pretty much ready to get out of Indiana, having already spent more time crossing Ohio than I had hoped.  The day started out as a more or less routine one of grinding out miles across cornfields.  The wind was quite strong in the aftermath of the storm, but it had returned to its normal direction (southwest), so I concluded that the rain was probably over for the day.  The weather was hot and humid, and the pace pretty slow.  I ran into some eastbounders in Denver, IN.  I wouldn't have recognized them as tourists because they were travelling on unloaded bikes, but one of them stopped to talk to me.  They are a group of three men in their late 50s/early 60s doing the Northern Tier in sections while somebody's wife drives the camper/sag-wagon behind.  Boy, these guys have it easy: not only are they eastbound but supported as well!  And he had the nerve to complain to me about headwinds!  ""Take a look at that flag"" I said.  My goal for today after I realized that it would be abbreviated by rain was to make it to Rensselaer, IN.  I'm passing through a part of Indiana where the campgrounds are scarce (and so is the population), so I had to shoot for a town with a motel.  Upon, arriving in Rensselaer, I was greeted by a parade of hot-rods (in fact, some locals had stopped me about two miles from town to warn me that it was happening today). I would estimate that there was well over one hundred cars in the parade, and after it was over they proceeded to cruise the town revving engines and peeping tires much to the delight of the townsfolk, who had turned out to the last man to observe the spectacle.  I suppose this is some sort of July Forth weekend event that happens every year.  I ended up picking the B&B for the night since the only other option was a motel on the interstate.  It might have been cheaper, but I would really hate staying on an interstate strip four miles outside of town.  At least this way I could walk around town and watch the cars go by.  I think I was making slightly better time on foot than the cruisers were, but maybe that's their point.",0

I understand that argument, but I do think it requires a leap of logic (or at least some creative interpretation) to get from the DFSG to this position. While I can see why some people do not want CDDL-licensed software in main for the above reason, I do not think it is fair to call it the Debian position that this is the case; at least not yet.  Counter-arguments: * The bit ""(except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides   otherwise)"" means you don't necessarily have to give up all your   rights. There are parts of copyright law in most jurisdictions that   give unalienable rights to users; those fall under the above   provision, by definition. The net result of your first clause   therefore may be, depending on circumstances, that users actually get   _more_ rights than what they started out with if that provision wasn't   there, because their own copyright law doesn't give them nearly as   much rights as the copyright law in the country where the software was   written would. * Your second quote is a non-issue. The same is true for GPL-licensed   software; if not, then why did we have to consult two lawyers back   when we moved crypto to main? And why do we still have such insane   procedures today when some crypto-using software gets through NEW?   (you don't see them because ftp-masters handle them, but they're still   there).  Additionally, personally I don't think it's unreasonable for people to say ""if you use my software in a way that I didn't want you to, I'll sue you in a court that works by a set of rules that I'm actually comfortable with"". You know, it makes fighting those who do not follow your license the way you intended them to quite a bit easier.  --  Shaw's Principle: 	Build a system that even a fool can use, and only a fool will 	want to use it.   --  To UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org with a subject of ""unsubscribe"".

The paper is available on the Publications page of my website, www.EHirst.com << File: http://www.ehirst.com/ >> . Please let me know if you have any comments on the paper. Here is a summary of the paper:         California was supposed to show the rest of the nation a brighter electricity future. That future, as outlined by the California Public Utilities Commission in 1994, envisioned an electricity industry featuring competitive markets. Such markets were intended to produce lower costs and more choices for consumers, while ensuring profits for efficient energy suppliers and encouraging the retirement of old, inefficient power plants.         Although the first two years of restructuring (beginning in April 1998) seemed to bear out these promises, the last year has been a disaster for California's electricity consumers, taxpayers, and electric utilities. Part of the fallout from California's electricity crisis is considerable concern-even opposition-in other states to restructuring the electricity industry.          Although a few states have decided, based on the California experience, not to restructure, I believe that is the wrong outcome. Instead, the primary lessons other states should learn from California are that competitive markets can work; competition is not to blame for California's problems; and basic economic principles of supply, demand, and prices affect market outcomes.         Section 2 of this paper briefly reviews the history of electricity regulation and restructuring in California and the problems that occurred beginning in May 2000. Section 3, the heart of this paper, offers guidance to other states on the key ingredients of a competitive electricity industry. This section makes several points:   Maintain a favorable investment and regulatory climate for new generation to ensure that enough generation capacity is online and planned to meet growing loads.   Ensure that enough infrastructure (transmission capacity and natural gas pipeline capacity) is in place and planned to meet growing loads, maintain reliability, connect new generators to the grid, support large regional markets, and provide fuel to power plants.   Encourage retail customers to participate in dynamic-pricing and voluntary-load-reduction programs (i.e., couple retail and wholesale markets).   Create honest retail competition: avoid standard-offer rates with artificial discounts and create conditions that encourage many companies to offer retail services without favoring individual competitors.   Encourage electricity suppliers to manage and diversify their supply and price risks.   Create efficient and integrated wholesale markets for energy, ancillary services, and transmission congestion.   Monitor and minimize horizontal market power (generation) and vertical market power (combined ownership and operation of generation and transmission).           Ultimately, competitive markets for electricity will lower costs and prices, better align consumer prices with producer costs, improve producer efficiency in both investment and operation, maintain or improve reliability, and yield greater innovation in customer services and pricing options.          But, this transition from one industry structure to another is turning out to be long and complicated. It is complicated because electricity is so important to our modern, high-tech society; electricity is our most flexible fuel, providing light, heat, motive power, and the energy to operate all our electronic equipment. Also, electricity truly is a real-time product for which production and consumption must occur at the same time.          Although the problems that have occurred in California are substantial and worrisome, regulators and legislators in other states should focus on the long-term benefits of competitive electricity markets and accept the possible short-term problems that may occur. They also need to recognize that wholesale markets are regional in scope and extend far beyond the boundaries of any single state. Finally, competition in retail and wholesale markets must be coordinated; in particular, it is not possible to have competitive wholesale markets unless at least some retail load faces time varying prices.          If states restructure properly to create competitive markets for wholesale energy and retail services, we should all benefit. Consumers will enjoy lower prices, they will have many more choices of energy services and price-risk tradeoffs, reliability will be improved because most reliability services will be obtained through markets instead of by engineering edict, and the financial risks associated with building and operating power plants will be assigned properly to investors rather than consumers.

This blew me away: in Barack's victory in Virginia last night, he won 142,000  more votes than all of the Republicans combined, and his victory margin over  Senator Clinton was larger than John McCain's entire vote total. All of this,  in what the Old Guard liked to pretend was ""red state"" Virginia.  When Barack and I rode together in the motorcade in Charleston, South Carolina  on the day I gave him my endorsement, we talked about the three-million-member- strong johnkerry.com community. We both agreed that this email list was a  community of supporters, not an ATM machine.  And so these last weeks, as I've talked with you, as Barack introduced himself  to you, as Ted Kennedy talked about Barack's commitment to health care for all,  and Gov. Tim Kaine talked about Barack's ability to unite our country -- we  haven't asked you to dig into your pockets.  We've asked you to get to know  Barack, to study his positions, to make phone calls to your neighbors, to go  door to door -- to get involved.  But today, I ask you to consider making a contribution as the campaign enters a  new phase. Wisconsin, Texas, Ohio, Pennsylvania -- the next big contests in  this campaign are big media market states, huge states that are expensive to  build statewide field organizations in, and Barack has a lot of ground to make  up. To win, Barack can use all of our help.  Click here to donate what you can: http://click.email.johnkerry.com/?ju=fe6216757361027d7511&ls=fdf715747c670c7977157370&m=fefd1273716607&l=fecd177070660c7d&s=fe2f167176660674721171&jb=ffcf14&t=    So there it is. I know not everyone here is an Obama supporter, and diversity  of opinion is a strength, not a weakness of our community -- but you've ""had my  back"" in so many fights these last years, I knew I could ask you to consider  signing up for another mission.  I have to tell you, this campaign has me excited. Excited, because I have seen  so much hope out there as I've traveled the country for Barack. Excited,  because as frustrated as I've been that the three words ""George W. Bush""  silenced any conversation at dinner tables around the country the last  eight years, I think we've found three words that will open a conversation  across the old divides, regardless of race, religion, gender, or income level -- and those three words are ""President Barack Obama"".  So please, click here to contribute what you can for Barack's campaign: http://click.email.johnkerry.com/?ju=fe6216757361027d7511&ls=fdf715747c670c7977157370&m=fefd1273716607&l=fecd177070660c7d&s=fe2f167176660674721171&jb=ffcf14&t=   I care about making this happen. I care about seeing Barack Obama win against  John McCain in a way that will break the Republican Roadblock in the Senate and  grow our progressive majority in the Congress.

legitimate,phishing,True,"RE: Discussion of California Background & Issues Jim, would it be logical to go back to March 27 (or whatever the date of the order was made that made this permanent).  And I'm not sure how it could hurt us with our customers.  They have a fixed price contract.  We absorbed this charge.  Wouldn't the refund be ours?  -----Original Message----- From: 	Steffes, James D.   Sent:	Thursday, August 02, 2001 8:16 AM To:	Williams, Robert C. Subject:	RE: Discussion of California Background & Issues Bob -- For certain we are seeking to not have the 1 c/kwh Surcharge post March 2002.  I think that I would be happy to begin to try and get the CPUC to modify their Order right now, but my real concern (maybe unfounded) is that we don't want the CPUC to go all the way back to Jan 4 and refund the 1c/kwh to Direct Access customers.  I thought this would harm EES given our de-dasr activities?  This is what I mean by ""finessing"" the issue too much.  The only legitimate positions are no application back to Jan 4 or to fight for a clean-up after the retail rate freeze ends. I make this based on the following.  First, it is hard for EES to push much at the CPUC.  Second, after the CPUC takes what will be a potentially direct access killing action on Aug 23, I don't think they are going to be interested in dealing with a ""detail"" that matters for only for direct access customers.  Finally, I need to understand the value of this effort in line with the other key value drivers - and also, are you completely sure that there isn't a change (however unforseen) that could hurt another of our positions.  Let's not create a fuss if the outcome could be harmful. I'm ready to push for this, but I want to make sure that everyone on the business side understands the issues.

Next, with respect to item 6, this implies to me that we are not seeking relief from  the 1 cent except for the post-March 2002 time period.  Have I misread this?

The sale is for September, 2001 production.  We will need a deal put in Sitara for that sale along with the appropriate pathing from storage by logistics.

legitimate,phishing,True,"Bike Diary #6 Day 13 Date: Thursday July 5, 2001 Distance: 85 miles Moving average speed: 13.1 mph Left at: 8:00 AM Arrived at: 4:00 PM Overnight in: cyclist shelter in Monroeville, IN Latitude 40 d 58 m 7 s N Longitude 84 d 51 m 55 s W Cumulative distance: 1058 miles  Today I passed two major milestones: I crossed another state border (Ohio to Indiana, and yes, I took that picture of the sign), and I logged my 1000th mile.  Now it's easy to extrapolate forward: if I covered 1000 miles in 13 days then I should cover 4000 miles in 52 days, which is 7 weeks and 3 days, within the range of my 6-to-8 week predeparture prediction.  52 days from my starting date (June 23) is August 13.  I would estimate the error on that prediction to be +/- 4 days, on the grounds that I added 1 day of riding to the first 1000 miles to nurse an injured knee, which extrapolates to 4 days over 4000 miles.  The weather today was fine, sunny with a high in the 70s, and the riding conditions would have been perfect were it not for the damn headwind.  It was from the northwest this time, so I could get a  little component of it behind me every time my route turned a little bit south.  But along the stretches of roads aligned due west it was a real grind.  I should digress on the subject of that headwind.  If I could have a nickel for every time somebody has told me that I am riding the ""wrong way"" across the country because the prevailing winds blow from west to east, then I would start getting invited to Bill Gates' parties.  Generally speaking, my interlocutors do not even appreciate the full difficulty of riding from east to west, because not only are the prevailing winds against you, but so are the prevailing hills.  You may recall from a previous Bike Diary entry my discussion of why it is that one should always prefer to go gradually down hill as opposed to an exhilerating rapid descent that squanders all the energy gained from climbing into wind resistance (this is not my opinion, it is a fact of physics).  Well, if you think about it, Denver is a mile high (5000 feet above sea level), but still east of the Front Range of the Rockies.  The Mississippi River, on the other hand, is only a few hundred feet above sea level.  This is true everywhere as you approach the Rockies from the east (for example, Cut Bank, MT on my route is just short of 4000 feet elevation).  Therefore, going west across the great plains you are gradually climbing, only to rapidly descend again when you get across the continental divide. The eastbounders, on the other hand, get the benefit of playing out their altitude gain gradually over a long distance as they descend across the great plains.  So, why go west?  Personally, I feel that flying to the west coast and bicycling back is the moral equivalent of getting air lifted to the top of Everest, skiing down to the base camp and then claiming to have climbed the mountain.  It is as if you wanted the bragging rights to say you rode your bicycle across the country, but you wanted to obtain them with the least amount of exertion necessary.  If you live on the east coast, and you want to ride across the continent, it seems perfectly obvious to me that what you need to do is ride west.  One should not undertake such a project as this if you want to do something easy.  OK, end of tirade.  Just remember this the next time you meet someone who claims to have bicycled across the country: the westbounders are the real cyclists.  Speaking of westbounders, I may be closing in on some ahead of me. I stopped in at the bicycle store in Defiance, OH to see if they had any news of westbounders.  Apparently a couple, short in stature, had passed through four days ago.  I wonder if this is the same couple making a perimeter tour that I heard about from the scruffy eastbounder on route 20 in upstate NY (see Day 4, Bike Diary #2).  If so, they were 8-9 days ahead of me then and are only 4 days ahead of me now, so I may be closing the gap.  In 10 days I've gained 4 on them, with 4 more to go, so I would guess that I will probably catch up to them in another 10 days, around July 15.  Stay tuned.  I'm spending tonight in Monroeville, IN.  Monroeville is like the set of a Frank Capra movie: you have your supper in the Village Cafe (two fried pork chops with mashed potatoes and gravy and a side salad for six bucks) and a chocolate malted from the Whippy Dip for dessert. The clientele of the Whippy Dip is a small crowd of flirting teenagers, there's a little league baseball game going on the playing field in the city park, and after dark the fireflies come out in swarms. You may have thought that places like this didn't exist any more, but here in middle America civil small town life is alive and well. You don't lock up your bike and you don't worry about it, either.  My accomodation here in Monroeville is a pavillion in the city park that has been set up as a shelter specifically for long distance touring cyclists.  There's a small bathroom with every imaginable amenity from warm shower to washer/dryer for your laundry.  The hospitable residents of Monroeville expect nothing in return: you can leave a donation but there's no obligation.  There's a guest book where you can leave your name, starting point and destination, and from the list of names it appears that Monroeville is a popular destination for touring cyclists: there's a few coming through every couple of days. I scanned the list for evidence of westbounders ahead of me to no avail.  Day 14 Date: Friday July 6, 2001 Distance: 83 miles Moving average speed: 14.1 mph Left at 7:30 AM Arrived at 2:30 PM Overnight in Salamonie River State Forest near Wabash, IN Latitude 40 d 48 m 42 s N Longitude 85 d 41 m 53 s W Cumulative distance: 1141  Although I rode 83 miles today, I only advanced 56 along the route to Seattle.  There were two reasons for the extra 27 miles today, the first was an inadvertent detour first thing in the morning when I left Monroeville headed in the wrong direction.  Here's and important fact for you future trans-America cyclists to remember: the sun rises in the east and sets in the west.  Therefore, if you are navigating the midwestern grid on a sunny morning thinking that you are going west but you do not see your shadow in front of you, then something is terribly wrong. It took me about three or four miles to notice this discrepancy, miles which I had to double back, of course.  The second detour was up to Fort Wayne to pick up some mail that my friends Maria and Kate sent me (thanks Kate! thanks Maria!).  I love mail.  The rest of the day was full of county roads and cornfields in Indiana. The wind more or less behaved itself today, starting the morning from the southeast before settling back into its usual pattern of coming from the southwest.  It wasn't much of a wind in either direction, maybe 5-10 mph.  I could easily have made it a longer day, but there is a real scarcity of services along this particular stretch of the route.  The next campground is 38 miles farther on, and there isn't a motel in the next 87 miles.  I probably could have managed the 38 miles to the next campground, but in deference to my still aching knees I quit much earlier in the afternoon than I would normally.  It looks like I made an impressively early start today, but that turns out to be a bit of a trick.  Although most of Indiana is in the eastern time zone, the state does not observe daylight savings time (except for the part in the cental time zone, just for maximum confusion) so at this time of year I crossed into the central time zone for all practical purposes when I crossed the Indiana border.  My campground tonight is a ""primitive facility"" which translates to no shower and pit toilets.  Generally speaking, I don't much mind primitive campgrounds as they are generally alot emptier than the ones that cater to the RV crowd and provide full hookups (water and electrical).  This one is an exception to that rule: there's hardly a vacant site.  I suppose it must be because of the holiday weekend since there isn't anything terribly exciting to do in the neighborhood. Most of the other campers are sitting in their sites experimenting  with all the noise-making gear they have brought along (firecrackers, car stereos, bongo drums, you name it).  Oh well, after all these days on the road I think I could sleep through anything.  Day 15 Date: Saturday July 7, 2001 Distance: 86 miles Moving average speed: 12.1 mph Left at 9:30 AM Arrived at 6:15 PM Overnight in White House B&B in Rensselaer, IN Latitude 40 d 55 m 52 s N Longitude 87 d 9 m 6 s W Cumulative distance: 1227 miles  I awoke this morning at 5 AM (EST) to the sound of distant thunder.  At first, I didn't realize that it was thunder I was hearing.  I'm accustomed to thunder as an intermitent booming; the sound I hear this morning was a continuous background.  After I had ruled out military aircraft on manueovers as a possible source for the sound I heard, I realized that I was in big trouble.  My immediate thought was ""strike the tent and seek shelter"".  That probably seems strange to alot of people who figure that the tent IS shelter, but you may recall from my first night's experience that if the tent is pitched on a slope, then it provides precious little shelter from runoff soaking through the floor of the tent.  I had once again pitched the tent on a slope, not expecting rain.  In fact, it seemed that most of the folks in the campground were not expecting (or at least prepared for) the rain that came.  By 6 AM I had my gear stowed my gear and loaded on the bicycle, and I moved myself and the bicycle to the only shelter on the campground: a pavillion that protected, ironically enough, the campground's water supply. The water supply itself was nothing but a spigot, but it spilled into a catch basin that looked like it came out of a coroner's office: it was a shallow sink no wider than usual but long enough to lay down in.  The pavillion overhangs this sink by three or four feet on any side, therefore the entire sheltered area was no bigger than about eight by ten feet.  At 6:10 AM the rains came with a vengance.  I cannot remember the last time I saw such torrential rain and so much lightning.  I believe that more than four inches of rain fell during the next three and a half hours, with lightning hitting very close to where I was standing.  I now could under- stand why the distant thunder had been continuous, because I was now standing in the middle of it.  And there I stood, for about three and a half hours, making light conversation with some of the other campers who dared step out in the storm and waiting for it to end.  One guy seemed to have an unnaturally detailed knowledge of the roads and motels of Indiana; when I asked him what line of work he was in he said he was following power lines.  Apparently utilities hire these guys to go around the state following the power lines to make sure there are no trees nearby that threaten to fall on them.  At 9:30 AM it was clear that the worst of the storm had passed and I decided to head out and make the most of what was left of the day. I'm pretty much ready to get out of Indiana, having already spent more time crossing Ohio than I had hoped.  The day started out as a more or less routine one of grinding out miles across cornfields.  The wind was quite strong in the aftermath of the storm, but it had returned to its normal direction (southwest), so I concluded that the rain was probably over for the day.  The weather was hot and humid, and the pace pretty slow.  I ran into some eastbounders in Denver, IN.  I wouldn't have recognized them as tourists because they were travelling on unloaded bikes, but one of them stopped to talk to me.  They are a group of three men in their late 50s/early 60s doing the Northern Tier in sections while somebody's wife drives the camper/sag-wagon behind.  Boy, these guys have it easy: not only are they eastbound but supported as well!  And he had the nerve to complain to me about headwinds!  ""Take a look at that flag"" I said.  My goal for today after I realized that it would be abbreviated by rain was to make it to Rensselaer, IN.  I'm passing through a part of Indiana where the campgrounds are scarce (and so is the population), so I had to shoot for a town with a motel.  Upon, arriving in Rensselaer, I was greeted by a parade of hot-rods (in fact, some locals had stopped me about two miles from town to warn me that it was happening today). I would estimate that there was well over one hundred cars in the parade, and after it was over they proceeded to cruise the town revving engines and peeping tires much to the delight of the townsfolk, who had turned out to the last man to observe the spectacle.  I suppose this is some sort of July Forth weekend event that happens every year.  I ended up picking the B&B for the night since the only other option was a motel on the interstate.  It might have been cheaper, but I would really hate staying on an interstate strip four miles outside of town.  At least this way I could walk around town and watch the cars go by.  I think I was making slightly better time on foot than the cruisers were, but maybe that's their point.",0

legitimate,phishing,True,"re : transitional assignments all i have received a few notes about this since this one but i will try to respond to all questions here . please see below responses in red : enron capital sally - husband and 3 children - ages 15 , 11 and 2 ) . i understand that the houses which have been vacated due to returning expats have all been filled , so can you have someone arrange for corporate housing that will accommodate them ? i think the best way to go here is for us to use serviced apartments as it will be very difficult to find a lease for such a short period for this type of accommodation . my assistant , lisa , has put a call in to a service who can help us find serviced accommodation in south kensington / chelsea area or in dolphin square where we have people now who are very satisfied . is there a reason you are partial to south kensington / chelsea ? what if we find accommodation in another nice area of london within a short commute to the office ? when i have some options , i will let you know , probably on monday . immigration - due to the fact that they will be traveling back and forth and have made trips already , i feel it would be best to apply for work permits versus using the visa waiver . i have sent them the forms and requested that brent complete his and file immediately to increase chances of getting his sometime shortly after he arrives in the uk . i have informed him that he should arrive without his family if the permit has not been received by april 1 . brent ' s work permit will be submitted today and we may receive if before april lst , but it is unlikely . the way it works for this is as follows : brent will receive the work permit from us and if he is here , he will have to leave the uk and enter with the work permit for it to be validated . if his family are in houston , they will need to receive entry clearance in the us prior to arriving in the uk . this takes approx 7 working days and they will require either brent ' s original passport and work permit or a certified copy of each along with other things such as marriage and birth certificates . if brent decides to bring his family with him to london prior to receiving the work permit , they must say they are coming on a vacation for a short period of time and have a return ticket to back it up . once the permit is received , the family can either travel back to houston and submit the entry clearance visas there or they can all travel to amsterdam where they are currenlty issuing entry clearance without a problem . there is always a small element of risk in going to amsterdam , however , as do not have to issue the stamps there , they just do it because they are nice ! work permits are arriving approx 4 weeks from date of submission . we can discuss all of this on the 20 th . tax - please confirm whether paye will need to be paid for them during the short term assignment and then reclaimed through a treaty benefit . paye is due after 60 days ; however , if brent and sally are really only going to be here for approx 75 days , i am not going to inform the revenue that they are here . if this extends beyond the set time , we can look at options but the only responsiblility that brent and sally will have is to ensure they complete the tax organiser in order for us to get the tax back . also , as we would have to apply the treaty here , we need to ensure the salary costs stay in houston . jane , have you discussed this point ? benefits - i have suggested that they remain on us domestic payroll and benefits and , if medical claims arise that exceed what they would have spent in the us , they may claim the excess on the expense report . agreed . per diem - we need to discuss the appropriate amount based on family size . jane , please call me to discuss . i have left you a message , thanks let me know of any other issues we need to address . as always , i appreciate your help . jane",0

legitimate,phishing,True,"Victory!  Progressives defeat a right-wing Dem in Congress Dear MoveOn member,  We've been working together for years to make sure Democrats hold to progressive values and stand up to President Bush. It hasn't always been easy. But yesterday, something amazing happened.  In what the Washington Post called a ""stunning victory,""1 progressive underdog Donna Edwards triumphed in her primary against right-wing Democrat Al Wynn. That's one more vote for ending the war, for affordable health care, for ending global warming. And thousands of MoveOn members pitched in time, money, and shoe leather to make it possible.  It's a big deal, because it's not just about this race--it's about reminding the rest of the Democrats in Congress that at the end of the day, the voters call the shots.  We need to build on this success--to keep putting pressure on Democrats who have lost sight of progressive values, even as we gear up to win the White House in the fall.  Our plan is to use grassroots tactics, advertising, and yes, more primary elections. We'll do it hand-in-hand with our partners at the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and Working for Us PAC.  Can you donate $100 to support a major campaign to hold Democrats accountable? Click here:  https://pol.moveon.org/donate/democratsaccountable.html?id=12121-4776693-O.m6e2&t=260  In 2006, we helped Democrats take back Congress from the Republicans. And while many Democrats have stood up against the war and corporate interests, some have folded.  Holding those people accountable is what we're about. In some cases, sending a clear message to Democrats may be as simple as flooding their offices with calls, or running ads in their district on a key issue. In other cases, getting involved in primary elections is one of the best ways to hold them accountable. In those cases, we'll look for more strong progressive challengers like Donna Edwards, and if there is no challenger in the district, we might help recruit one.  MoveOn members joined with union members and other progressives--including, ACORN, Democracy for America, EMILY's List, the League of Conservation Voters, Progressive Maryland, SEIU, Sierra Cub, United Food and Commercial Workers, Women's Voices, Women's Votes, and more--to help put it over the top for Donna Edwards.  Together we ran ads to educate voters, contributed thousands to Donna's campaign, and hit the streets to turn out voters.  A few months back, we surveyed MoveOn members about Democratic accountability and over 78% said this should be a major priority for the year. Donna Edwards' victory is proof that Democrats in Congress who vote like Republicans can be defeated.  Working with SEIU and Working for Us PAC, MoveOn members can help fight for a majority that's not just Democratic, but progressive.  Can you chip in $100 to support our campaign to make it happen now?  https://pol.moveon.org/donate/democratsaccountable.html?id=12121-4776693-O.m6e2&t=261  Thank you.  --Adam, Eli, Daniel, Joan, and the MoveOn.org Political Action Team   Wednesday, February 13th, 2008  1.

legitimate,phishing,True,"Lindows.com: Michael's Minute: Lindows.com Report Card ------=_LINDOWS_1890362a5620f32f969ae58b8fe2ef84 Content-Type: text/plain; 	charset=""us-ascii"" Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit If this message is not displaying properly, click  here to launch it in your browser.   Michael's Minute:  Lindows.com Report Card  As summer arrives, many school children are coming home with their report cards.  I thought this would be a good time to see what kind of grades Lindows.com received for their first 9 months in operation..   To view the Timeline of Lindows.com's first 9 months in business, click here  .  Operating System:   As of last week, consumers can experience LindowsOS in one of two ways. One way is to buy a computer running LindowsOS from Walmart.com  , for as little as $299. This is a significant milestone for us, as we've partnered with our first builder (Microtel) and retailer (Walmart). These computers work great out of the box and are ideal for general purpose computing tasks.  For those who already have a computer and also wish to try LindowsOS, we offer the Insider program  . This gives people wanting early access to LindowsOS a chance to try out LindowsOS as it develops. Currently, Insiders report installation success about 80%  of the time on their PCs. Therefore we have some room to grow, consequently, this product is not yet for everyone.  Some may wonder how we can sell a computer at Walmart  when the program available directly from Lindows.com is billed as not completely ready. The difference is the Walmart   computers are certified, ensuring that all components  work elegantly with LindowsOS. That's much different than offering a software program that will work on any computer in the world - that's very difficult. It's the difference between making a single pair of shoes for a known foot size versus opening a shoe store with every style of shoe for every size foot. The first one is easy, the second one is a much bigger job. While the installer is fantastically easy and fast (the entire OS installs in under 5 minutes), we've got a lot more work to do to support a wider range of hardware, printers and other devices. Grade:  B   _____   Software:  Our goal to give people choice means giving them choice not just on their operating system, but access to all the programs they'll want to add to their computer to really make it work for them in their school, home or business. Click-N-Run   is the easiest way to load software onto a computer. For the first time a Linux based system has leapt ahead of Microsoft's operating systems in ease of use. With 1,000 plus programs already in the Click-N-Run Warehouse  , users can find quality software titles for just about any computing task and, with a single mouse-click download, install and run these programs. All these titles are included in the $99. This is a fantastic consumer experience and price point. Look for a lot more great software in the Warehouse in the future. Grade: A-   _____   Microsoft Windows Compatibility: We live in a Microsoft world, so there needs to be a bridge from the legacy world to the broadband LindowsOS world. This means we need to support some bridge programs, file types and network devices to help people interact with the legacy Microsoft world. LindowsOS computers come with software to view, print and copy popular Microsoft applications like: MS Word files, MS PowerPoint files and MS Excel documents. There's great Linux based alternatives and we'll guide people to those alternatives (they're better than most people realize). To edit Microsoft files, we'd highly recommend one of the office suites in our Warehouse such as OpenOffice  .  Many of these programs are of very high-quality and a great value since they're included in the Warehouse  . Sometimes there are no viable alternatives for those programs, so we're investing necessary resources to support some Microsoft Windows based programs. Stay tuned for more developments in this area. Our printer support is ok, but there's lots of room for more drivers. Connecting to MS Windows based file servers is still a challenge. We need to get better in the above areas.  Grade: B    _____   Communication: We've tried to be diligent in communicating where our company is going which is why there's typically a weekly Michael's Minute  . While our overall goal has not deviated - Bringing Choice To Your Computer - our implementation has become more focused as we listened to what our Insiders and potential customers have told us. (Keep sending me your comments.) We have been de-emphasizing running Microsoft Windows programs because many of you told us you detest spending hundreds of dollars on individual software programs, forced upgrades and activation codes. It's not just the operating system, but costly Microsoft programs you're wanting to avoid.  Consequently, we've been emphasizing Click-N-Run because it will change the way you think about software. Having a neatly categorized library   of 1,000+ software titles all for a flat annual fee at your digital fingertips is an entirely new way to think about paying for software. It's immediate, elegant and affordable. There are lots of mischaracterizations about Lindows.com swirling around - which happens when you have a small organization which can't address every question or publication. We'll do a better job of addressing these in the future. For now, I wrote up answers to the Top Myths about Lindows.com. Check them out by visiting: www.lindows.com/myths  Grade: B+   _____   Overall: B+ Michael Robertson Please visit support.lindows.com   to answer questions you may have about LindowsOS or Lindows.com. Bringing Choice to Your Computer!    LindowsOS is presently available on LindowsOS Certified Computers being offered from Lindows.com   Builder partners.  The General Release of LindowsOS (available now for download and preview to Lindows.com   Insider partners) will be made available later this year for those wishing to install and run LindowsOS on their existing computer hardware.  The General Release version will support a wider range of computer hardware and includes unique features such as a ""Friendly-Install"" alongside an existing MicrosoftR Windows operating system, a streamlined installation process which requires no computer knowledge, and the ability to run a select set of ""bridge"" Windows-compatible programs.

legitimate,phishing,True,"RE: Enron's Advocacy in California Jim, We can talk at greater length if you want, but the quick answers to your questions are: 1. PX Credit: Make it simple and transparent.  Best outcome would be no credit -- DA pays T&D costs only, as they appear in the tariff.  Period, end of story. 2. The UDC Financial Hole: The more relief we can get from these items, the better.  Duh.  The small surcharge ($10) is currently factored into in our curves, so the hope is that whatever ultimately emerges from the sausage factory, the ultimate amount that they try to stick on DA customers is < $10.

I would appreciate comments from anyone, pro or > con, with knowledge and experience of these things, however, as I'm rather > limited on both.  I agree - it's never a good idea to use the same data for creating your classifier and determining it's effectiveness (I meant to say ""pick the one with the lowest error rate on your TEST data"").  The reason to choose from many random starts is that fitting a given neural network _model_ (ie. input x, n nodes, ...) is very hard due to the large overparameterisation of the problem space.  For example, the parameters for one node in a given layer can be exchanged with the parameters of another node (as well as the parameters that use those nodes in next layer), without changing the overall model.  This makes it very hard to optimise, and nnet in R often gets stuck in local minima. Looking at what individual nodes are doing, you often see examples where some nodes contribute nothing to the overall classification. The random starts aren't to find different models but to find the parameters for the given model that fits best.  And following this line of argument, you would probably want to use the internal criterion value, rather than some external measure of accuracy.  > The simple answer to the question of obtaining the error rate using > validation data is: Do whatever you like to choose/fit a classifier on the > training set. **Once you are done,** the estimate of your error rate is the > error rate you get on applying that classifier to the validation set.

You need yet new validation data for that.  Understanding that that estimate is biased is important, but in practice, do people really care that much?  If you have looked at a single plot of your data and used that to inform your choice of the classifier your estimates will already be biased (but if you have used other knowledge of the data or subject area, you might expect them to be biased in a positive direction). Are the estimates of model really the most important thing?  Surely an understanding of the problem/data is what you are really trying to gain.

While games programs have been engineered for efficiency from the early days, high-performance planners are a relatively recent development.  Both planning and games are important fields of research in the Artificial Intelligence community. A trend in the computer game community, exemplified in initiatives such as the General Game Playing Project and ORTS, has been on playing whole classes of games, and on increasing realism and complexity. This tests the limits of traditional game-tree search approaches. However, the planning community has a lot of experience in dealing with huge search spaces. Furthermore, such games also involve current topics of much current interest in planning, such as: time reasoning, resource management, imperfect information, cost-based planning, etc.  This workshop will discuss all aspects of using planning in the domain of games. Relevant topics include, but are not limited to:  - planning techniques for classical games - planning in commercial computer games - integration of planning and game tree search - representational issues: languages for planning in games - opportunities for technology transfer between the communities - competitions - planning stories and scenarios - planning and interactive narrative - integrating planning and affective systems - planning for NPCs - dialogue planning - reasoning about actions and game playing - plan recognition - learning plans  Important Dates: ================  Submission Deadline (extended):    June 25, 2007    11:59pm PST (Samoa time UTC-11)  Notifications and Technical Program:    July 13, 2007  Camera-Ready Paper Submissions:    July 31, 2007  Workshop Date:    September 23, 2007  Submission Procedure: =====================  We ask authors to submit technical papers in PDF format. Papers should be formatted in accordance with the AAAI style template and may be at most 8 pages long, including figures and bibliography. Visit the url http://www.aaai.org/Publications/Author/author.php for formatting instructions. Please submit papers via email to ombquvcukfr-kn6862@lab.inf.uc3m.es  Please note that all submitted papers will be carefully peer-reviewed by multiple reviewers, and that low-quality or off-topic papers will not be accepted.

legitimate,phishing,True,"re : transitional assignments all i have received a few notes about this since this one but i will try to respond to all questions here . please see below responses in red : enron capital sally - husband and 3 children - ages 15 , 11 and 2 ) . i understand that the houses which have been vacated due to returning expats have all been filled , so can you have someone arrange for corporate housing that will accommodate them ? i think the best way to go here is for us to use serviced apartments as it will be very difficult to find a lease for such a short period for this type of accommodation . my assistant , lisa , has put a call in to a service who can help us find serviced accommodation in south kensington / chelsea area or in dolphin square where we have people now who are very satisfied . is there a reason you are partial to south kensington / chelsea ? what if we find accommodation in another nice area of london within a short commute to the office ? when i have some options , i will let you know , probably on monday . immigration - due to the fact that they will be traveling back and forth and have made trips already , i feel it would be best to apply for work permits versus using the visa waiver . i have sent them the forms and requested that brent complete his and file immediately to increase chances of getting his sometime shortly after he arrives in the uk . i have informed him that he should arrive without his family if the permit has not been received by april 1 . brent ' s work permit will be submitted today and we may receive if before april lst , but it is unlikely . the way it works for this is as follows : brent will receive the work permit from us and if he is here , he will have to leave the uk and enter with the work permit for it to be validated . if his family are in houston , they will need to receive entry clearance in the us prior to arriving in the uk . this takes approx 7 working days and they will require either brent ' s original passport and work permit or a certified copy of each along with other things such as marriage and birth certificates . if brent decides to bring his family with him to london prior to receiving the work permit , they must say they are coming on a vacation for a short period of time and have a return ticket to back it up . once the permit is received , the family can either travel back to houston and submit the entry clearance visas there or they can all travel to amsterdam where they are currenlty issuing entry clearance without a problem . there is always a small element of risk in going to amsterdam , however , as do not have to issue the stamps there , they just do it because they are nice ! work permits are arriving approx 4 weeks from date of submission . we can discuss all of this on the 20 th . tax - please confirm whether paye will need to be paid for them during the short term assignment and then reclaimed through a treaty benefit . paye is due after 60 days ; however , if brent and sally are really only going to be here for approx 75 days , i am not going to inform the revenue that they are here . if this extends beyond the set time , we can look at options but the only responsiblility that brent and sally will have is to ensure they complete the tax organiser in order for us to get the tax back . also , as we would have to apply the treaty here , we need to ensure the salary costs stay in houston . jane , have you discussed this point ? benefits - i have suggested that they remain on us domestic payroll and benefits and , if medical claims arise that exceed what they would have spent in the us , they may claim the excess on the expense report . agreed . per diem - we need to discuss the appropriate amount based on family size . jane , please call me to discuss . i have left you a message , thanks let me know of any other issues we need to address . as always , i appreciate your help . jane",0

phishing,legitimate,True,"From: Mr.Al-Zarqawi Yusuf  From: Mr.Al-Zarqawi Yusuf  Dear Friend,  Your first reaction to this mail will be total rejection, scare and maybe disbelief, owning largely to the atrocities people commit these days.But this mail comes from a devastated, sorrowful and emotional laden soul that needs compassion from a kind and good spirited person to wipe away my tears and appropriate my dream and humanitarian gesture.  As you read this, I don't want you to  feel sorry for me, because, I believe everyone dies someday.,I am Al-Zarqawi Yusuf, A Oil merchant in Dubai, United Arab Emirate ( UAE). I have been diagnosed with Cancer, which was discovered very late, due to my laxity in caring for my health. It has defiled all forms of medicine; Right now I have only about a limited to live, according to my Medical Doctor. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for myself but the Oil business.Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.  I believe when Allah  gives me a second chance and  heal me I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it.I have sowed a seed for my healing I have willed and given most of my properties and assets to my immediate and extended family members and as well as a few close friends. i want Allah to be merciful to me and accept my soul and so, I have decided to give arms to charity organizations and give succor and comfort to the less privileged of the Tsunami and Hurricane Katrina Victims, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth so far, by distributed some of this money to some charity organizations in India,Hurricane Katrina victims in USA and other part of the world. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self anymore.I once asked members of my family  to close one of my accounts in Saudi Bank and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization and to the less  privileged in Bulgaria and Sudan.  They cashed the money but kept it only to themselves.  Hence I do not trust them anymore,as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them already.The last of my money, which no one knows of, is the huge cash deposit of Thirty Five Million United States Dollars ( US$35Million)  that I have in the Vault of The Security Company as family valuable since the year 2003 for safekeeping.I want you to collect this deposit on my behalf and disburse it to the Tsunami Earthquake victims in Asia for the less privileged. Please send me a mail to indicate your wiliness to assist in this disbursement.   I will set aside 10% for you for your time and efforts by notifying the security company as soon as i hear from you.I need your urgent reply with your full name and address, your Phone and Fax numbers and your Occupation so that I will not have to go on sourcing for a credible person to handle this project for himself and the rest of the less privileged.I will also plead to you to always pray for me because only Allah heals.   Wasaalam  Regards, Al-Zarqawi Yusuf.",1

I am from Dubai . I have been diagnosed with   Esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right   now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. I   have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for   anyone (not even myself)but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never   generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as   that was the only thing I cared for.     But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just   wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives   me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different   way from how I have lived it.     Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and   assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as few close   friends .I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have   decided to give alms to charity organizations and those in Need, as I want   this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth.     So far, I have Distributed money to some charity organizations when I was   well. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself   anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and   distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in United   States, Asia, Middle East & Europe, they refused and kept the money to   themselves.     Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with   what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the   huge cash deposit of ten Million United States Dollars ($10, 000,   000.00) that I have with an Asset Management / Vaulting Company Abroad. I   will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatch it to charity   organizations and use it to help those in Need.     N/B:Kindly note that 40% of this funds must go to victims of Tsunami,   Hurricane Katrina , Hurricane Wilma and South Asia Earthquake , 55% to other   Charity Organizations around the World and 5% for your effort and time.  I cannot talk with you on the phone due to my health situation, as I am   using my Lap Top Computer to communicate with you.

Stop procrastinating and act like a responsible adult. Taurus:Mix up your humdrum routine so your day is slightly less boring. Go crazy and try a new iced coffee flavor or wear a funky color underwear, even if it's doubtful that anyone will ever see them. Gemini:Your flair for remembering weird facts will come in handy today. You'll bring up something totally random to divert attention away from yet another sticky situation that you've gotten yourself into. Cancer:You'll butt heads with someone today due to 'creative differences.' The difference is that one of you isn't creative, and that's you. Let someone else come up with the unique ideas since all of yours are lame. Leo:Technology is not your friend when it comes to communicating today. In fact, messages probably spread faster in the Stone Age than via your computer. Use your land line if you want to touch base with someone or choose to remain incommunicado. Virgo:You're at it again. Buying things on a whim just to make yourself feel less empty inside. Sorry babe, but even truckloads of material possessions are going to bring you out of the dumps. Libra:Just because you're in the mood to socialize doesn't mean that others will be receptive to your conversational advances. You've been blowing off people left and right. Why the heck should they bother with you? Scorpio:Keep your fingers crossed that someone comes to your defense today. If you don't, then you're going to have a lot of explaining to do, and for once you didn't even do anything wrong!  Sagittarius:Say a goal aloud today. If you put it out there, then you might have a slight chance of it coming to fruition. It won't magically happen, though. You have to put some work into it, ya lazy bum. Capricorn:Today isn't the day to ask for a raise, or for any money for that matter. Your boss doesn't think you deserve it and your friends are a bunch of moochers. Aquarius:Whether you realize it or not, it'll be obvious to everyone that you're dealing with some issues. Drop the act and let people know what's going on. They like you better when you're not a total fake. Pisces:It's time to get off the roller coaster and find a kiddie ride that you can handle.

legitimate,phishing,True,"[python-win32] wmi, Win32_ScheduledJob and Execution User I've followed Tim Golden's cookbook example to schedule a job via his Python wmi module; however, I need to specify the user account a scheduled job gets executed under (i.e., the process owner).  The cookbook example will schedule a job owned by SYSTEM.  I note the actual WMI library provides for a User and Password option, which do not appear to be visible options from within the python wmi module's Win32_ScheduledJob call.  I am uncertain if the aforementioned User and Password options actually cause the scheduled job to be run as that user?  As a workaround I schedule my job via the Win32_ScheduledJob call and follow this up with a Win32_Process.Create call to ""schtasks.exe"", in which I change the job id's run user (i.e., via the /RU option) to the appropriate user name.  Is there a way I can specify the run (or execution) user of a scheduled job within the Win32_ScheduledJob call or via the wmi interface?  The way I am doing it right now, I could have simply called schtasks.exe directly and had it create the process with the intended run user, which I don't find very eloquent.

legitimate,phishing,True,"No Confidence in Congress Lou Dobbs Tonight Thursday, June 21, 2007  Tonight, a new Gallup poll reveals only 14 percent of Americans have confidence in the United States Congress. This poll comes on the heels of several others showing Congressional and Presidential approval ratings at the lowest level in years. What in the world is going on in Washington, and what can we do about it? We'll ask and asnwer those questions tonight.  More than 15 million children are at risk of dropping out of our nations schools, according to the Office of Juvenile Justice Department. With already more than a million students not lining up to graduate this year, there is a new outcry for parental involvement in childrens lives. Studies list parental involvement as key when it comes to combating dropout rates. Well have a full report tonight.  Illegal aliens are now taking extreme measures to cross our southern border, including starting fires near observation towers. The Border Patrol says apprehensions are down, but are these new diversion tactics to blame? We'll have a special report.  Senators Ted Kennedy and Dianne Feinstein held a press conference today touting the importance of a provision for illegal alien agricultural workers in the Senates immigration reform bill.  Meanwhile Senators Jim DeMint, Chuck Grassley and David Vitter are held a press conference discussing why the Senates so-called grand compromise will only repeat the failures of the past. Well report on the battle to get the bill back out on the floor.  And well take a look at the latest developments towards the creation of a North American Union between the United States, Mexico and Canada.  We'll also discuss the Senate's grand compromise on immigration with Senator Claire McCaskill. The Senator says we will never get a handle on illegal immigration until we hold employers accountable.  Visit http://cnn.com/loudobbstonight to read Lous latest commentary on a legacy in search of a president: More than 1.2 million students will not graduate public high school this year. Somebody needs to fix our broken education system in this country. Will the president assert real leadership on this issue?  Lou Dobbs lays out his manifesto to save the middle class in his new book, War on the Middle Class: How the Government, Big Business, and Special Interest Groups Are Waging War on the American Dream and How to Fight Back.

legitimate,phishing,True,"Cabot Wealth Advisiory 7/5/07 - TV, Intelligence and More July 5, 2007  Salem, Massachusetts  By Timothy Lutts  -----  There's Nothing On!  The SAT Measures What?  A Company With Predictive Decisioning Software  -----  My wife recently attended a conference in upstate New York and one night found herself back in her hotel room, turning to the television for entertainment.  Now, in our family, real-time network television is a rare event.    Thanks to Replay TV, a one-time competitor of TiVo in the DVR (digital video recorder) business, our favorite shows get recorded on a big hard disk and we watch them when we want, skipping the commercials as we go.  In fact, the only time we watch commercials is during the Super Bowl.  More often, we read.  In any event, there was my wife, in a New York state hotel room, ""forced"" to choose from a dreadful selection of real-time network TV offerings.  Of course she could have turned it off, but in that dull hotel room in that strange town, she was just searching for a little life, a little humor, a little intelligence.  What she got was bad TV, along with an onslaught of repetitive, often-insulting commercials.  So she called me, and somewhere along the way she asked, ""Why do people watch this garbage?  And why do the networks play the same commercials, sometimes several times during the same show?""  I couldn't give her an easy answer, but I did sympathize, and that's really what she wanted.  Soon after, I googled ""top ten TV shows,"" and here's what I found.  America's Got Talent Dateline NBC Deal or No Deal Law and Order N-C-I-S C-S-I Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader? Two and A Half Men So You Think You Can Dance? C-S-I Miami  I've never seen any of these, which goes to show you how out of touch I am.  But I do know (from reading) that four of them are crime dramas, two are talent searches, two are game shows, one is a sitcom and one is a news magazine that typically focuses on human-interest stories.  Reviewing this list, I'm reminded of the words of HL Mencken, who wrote, ""No one in this world, so far as I know, has ever lost money by underestimating the intelligence of the great masses of the plain people.""  Then, a few days ago one of my editors commented to me, no doubt after viewing one of the those headlines like ""Man Shoots Self in Groin While Attempting To Make Ham Sandwich,"" ""You know, half of Americans are of below average intelligence.""  Upon reflection, it's obvious.  And it's statistically inevitable.    The average is near the middle, so half will always be below the average (technically, below the median, but given the very large numbers we're dealing with, there's little difference.)  And if you don't know the difference between mean and median, you probably haven't crammed for an SAT test lately.  The converse, however, does not mean that if you do know the difference you have crammed for the test recently.  That's logic at work.  And the SAT, now that I've brought it up, is not what it used to be.  In 1901 it debuted as the Scholastic Achievement Test, supposedly measuring what students had learned.  In 1941, the name was changed to Scholastic Aptitude Test, supposedly measuring what students were capable of learning, if they had the proper socio-economic advantages.  In 1990, that was changed to Scholastic Assessment Test, supposedly measuring . . . something scholastic?  And in 1994 the name was changed to SAT (the letters officially standing for nothing at all!)  Finally (or, should I say, most recently, because I suspect there are more changes around the corner), in 2005 the name was changed to SAT Reasoning Test, creating a potential redundancy of the word ""Test"" but only if the first T still stood for Test, which it doesn't.  Reasoning, of course, includes logic, and I like that a lot. I hope they keep that name for a while.  Now, I took the SAT a few decades back.  Two of my kids have taken it and the third is likely to in a couple years.  But something else has changed over the decades besides the name.  In 1995 the yardstick for scoring was adjusted to account for the growing number of kids from less rigorous schools taking the test.  The reason?  The big bulge in the middle of the distribution curve, which had previously been centered at 400, had slipped down into the mid-300s.  To get the mid-point back up, the average verbal score was artificially increased by some 70 points while the average math score had 20-30 points added.  The kids at the top and bottom were barely affected, but the masses of average kids near the middle saw their scores bumped up dramatically.  What does it matter?  Well, a good score helps you get into college.    But is there a correlation between success on the SAT and success in college?  Looking further out, is there correlation between success on the SAT and success in life?  The simple answer is, some, but not a lot.  And more and more colleges are recognizing that; the number of colleges that admit students without regard to test scores now exceeds 400.  But the SAT lives on, and will continue to be here for years to come.  Why?  In part because it's the product of The College Board.    The College Board is a non-profit organization, and while there's no doubt that it works hard to serve the high schools and colleges and families that use it, there's even less doubt - in my mind - that the organization works even harder to ensure its own survival.   ----- ADVERTISEMENT -----  Join Cabot Stock of The Month and get in on the next stock that explodes like these...   * Broadvision-up 670%  * Intuitive Surgical-up 500%  * Yahoo-up 317%  * Amazon.com-up 1,290%  * First Marblehead-up 50%  * International Game Technology-up 110%  * eResearch Technology-up 180%  * NetEase-up 100%  * Expedia-up 114%  * Broadcom-up 97%  * Netflix-up 173%  * Psychiatric Solutions-up 85%  * PetroKazakhstan-up 86%  * Nautilus-up 109%  That's the beauty of Cabot Stock of the Month.

""A financial services firm in Japan has begun offering lower mortgage interest rates to ""intelligent"" customers.  GE Consumer Finance Company is giving discounts to people who have good English or computer skills, and work in ""high-value"" areas such as the law.  The company says more highly skilled workers usually find it easier than others to get jobs and to keep them. They are therefore less likely to become insolvent and default on their home loan.  GE Consumer Finance Company claims this is the first time that mortgage rates have been calculated like this in Japan.  People who have high scores on a test of English proficiency and officially certified IT skills can apply for a small discount.  Those of them who also have certain jobs - such as lawyers, accountants, doctors and financial experts - can obtain further discounts.  If a couple are both employed in the 20 ""high-value"" professions listed by the company, they will be entitled to a major rate reduction.""  It makes sense, and I'm guessing it's illegal to discriminate that way in the U.S.  -----  Getting back to TV, the problem is not just the quality of programming but the quantity of time people spend viewing.  The TV is on for over 7 hours in the average American home, and the average American watches over 4 hours of TV per day.  Worse still, the average American child watches 1,023 hours of TV a year and spends 900 hours in school.  And one thing they're seeing in those hours is commercials.  For broadcast TV, commercials pay the bills, and the advertisers are doing all they can to ensure that the message from those commercials reaches your brain.  But more and more these days, people are working to avoid those commercials by fast-forwarding through them using DVRs.  So NBC recently tested people to see if those commercials had any impact at high-speed.  NBC, you know, wants its advertisers' money even if viewers are watching at fast speeds.  The result, according to a story three days ago in The New York Times, ""judging from the biological reactions, the test subjects were just as engaged while watching fast-forwarded advertisements as they were while viewing opening scenes from the NBC show ""Heroes"" at regular speed.""  When it comes to fast-forward advertisements, ""the assumption has always been that they have no economic value, that they have no communication value,"" said Alan Wurtzel, president for research at NBC Universal. ""But the fact of the matter is we're learning that they are valuable.""  And they're so ""valuable"" to the financial health of the TV industry that the commercial-skipping DVR that I bought years ago can no longer be bought!  But the problem is not just the commercials.  The problem is that every minute spent watching TV is a minute not being used to reflect, to do something productive, or to interact with other family members.  And the result of all this TV viewing, according to a recent study by the Culture and Media Institute, is that ""increased exposure to television correlates with a decline in acceptance of personal responsibility.""  Now, it's important to note that the word correlate was used there.    Officially, there's no established causality.  But my sense is that our country has seen a marked decrease in a sense of personal responsibility; that too many people all too easily blame others for their troubles.  And when personal responsibility shrinks, we get a culture that thinks it's okay to act stupid because somebody else will pick up the tab.  ----- Contest -----  Now, there is an investment idea coming here, but first I want to give a reward to a loyal reader who has chosen to read this far.

Do it now.  -----  And now, finally, here we are at today's stock.  It's about intelligence and it's about marketing, and if you understand how important marketing is to the world, you may like this one enough to invest in it.  You know and I know that at every turn, companies are doing their darndest to sell us things.  At Amazon they know what I've bought before and thus know what to sell me next.  And at Netflix they know what movies I've rated highly so they can suggest other movies they think I'd enjoy.  Those two firms have developed specialized software that serves their individual needs, but for most companies, there's off-the-shelf software that works very well, and a lot of it is coming from a company named Chordiant.  Here's what we wrote in a recent issue of Cabot Top Ten Report.  ""Chordiant (CHRD) makes customer service and marketing software that helps big companies deal with their customers, so that the goals of both the merchant and the customer are met. Customers include 21st Century Insurance, Bank of Ireland, Banque Populaire, Barclays, Capital One, Covad Communications, Cox Communications, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Lloyds, MetLife, Nokia, Prudential, Royal Bank of Scotland, Royal Dutch Shell, Time Warner Cable, T-Mobile, UPS and Wachovia. These are huge blue-chip companies, yet Chordiant is still a small company, and growing fast. Historically, the company has had trouble making a profit (its last profitable year was 2004), but after the first quarter's terrific results, CEO Steven R. Springsteel commented that solid profitability was ""due to the strong performance in our international business, the acceleration of percentage of completion project implementations in Europe, and greater enablement of our partners resulting in fewer Chordiant resources being required on some project implementations."" It sounds good to us. Since then the company has been awarded a patent for ""advanced predictive decisioning technology."" In other words, the companies using this software sometimes know what you're going to buy before you do! As companies come to depend on this software, Chordiant's future is likely to be consistently profitable, and the realization of that is why the stock is strong today.""  Digging deeper, I see that Chordiant has been growing revenues since 2003, and in the latest quarter saw revenues grow 25% from the year before to $32.8 million, while earnings jumped from a penny per share to $0.18 per share.  Analysts are projecting a profit of $0.48 per share this year and $0.72 per share next year.  And the after-tax profit margin was a fat 19.6%.  Trading at 16, it's rather low-priced and thus carries the extra risk of volatility that comes from stocks at this level.   But average trading volume is nearly 500,000 shares per day, and institutional interest is growing.  I'd like it better on a dip to 15, but if it doesn't dip there in the week ahead, 16 may be the best price you'll get.  -----  Editor's note:  To get regular updates on Chordiant, and to get first notice of other hot stocks, consider a no-risk trial subscription to Cabot Top Ten Report.

Included in the payment to AEP is a deduction for the sale of the Centana storage gas.  We are selling them 1,236,286 MMBTU @ $2.375 for a total of $2,936,179.25.  The sale is for September, 2001 production.  We will need a deal put in Sitara for that sale along with the appropriate pathing from storage by logistics.  However, there is only 1,195,754 MMBTU on report 006 in Unify (for contracts 96018371, 96014189, and 96019236).  How do we account for this volumetic difference?  Connie will be truing up the GL to match the current Unify volume.  The GL was short approx. 18,000 MMBTU because a beginning balance was not booked.    This needs to happen before the upcoming close.  Thanks for you help in this matter.  Please let me know of any concerns.",0

legitimate,phishing,True,"Assessing the post September 11 Landscape: CERA's New Global Energy Initiative Assessing the post September 11 Landscape: CERA's New Global Energy Initiative  The uncertainties created by the attack on September 11 and the global response have created turmoil for near-term energy planning and investment decision making. Circumstances demand rapid reassessments of near-term risks and strategies. In response to client requests, CERA is undertaking a comprehensive, new initiative to develop a framework for understanding potential energy futures and their implications.  This special multiclient project will include interactive analyses, face-to-face workshops, and real-time updates. It will draw on CERA's broad industry and regional expertise, offering participants both a framework and a robust tool for evaluating strategies across all sectors of the energy business and all geographies. The focus will be on creating new and highly relevant insights into the energy future and the political and economic context. It will highlight both key trends and probable discontinuities -- and assess urgent issues in a setting that will promote thoughtful and informed dialogue.  By emphasizing both virtual and in-person exchanges among participating members and CERA experts, we will establish a three-year road map for decision makers across the energy business, to complement CERA's industry-specific and shorter-term analyses. In addition, the process will offer a unique opportunity to interact with others across the energy spectrum and to share ideas and experiences.  * Could the economic slowdown be prolonged and inflation be rekindled? * What is the impact on energy demand -- does the fuel mix shift? * How great are the risks for disruptions of supply? In which countries and for which fuels? * How would disruptions play out?  And how tumultuous will they be for energy companies? * How will energy policies change -- relative to energy security, environmental trade-offs, and fuel strategies? * Will the global coalition hold, or are we moving to a more divided and more fractured world? * How profound will be the changes for the energy business?  This timely series provides a three-year horizon that draws on the framework established in CERA's longer-term scenarios. It uses the clash between the ""Fragmentation"" and ""Globality"" scenarios as the starting point for assessing the new world in which energy-decision makers will operate and the critical choices they will face.  The first workshop will be held in Houston on November 15, in conjunction with CERA's Fall Roundtable series.  Additional workshops, both in Houston and other cities and via online technologies, will follow. We will announce the entire schedule, with events and deliverables, soon. The process will deliver a clear framework for anticipating the future, and conclusions for energy strategy.

But former CIA Director George Tenet lets loose in our first story in a public venting rare for any public official, never mind a CIA director. Tenet angrily accuses the Bush administration of ruining his reputation by misusing his now-famous ""slam dunk"" remark about Iraqi WMD to justify its march to war. ""It's the most despicable thing that ever happened to me,"" Tenet says. ""You don't do this. You don't throw somebody overboard just because it's a deflection. Is that honorable? It's not honorable to me,"" he tells correspondent Scott Pelley.  He also reveals in this double-length segment his anguish and frustration over the 9/11 attack, the first of the president's inner circle to provide a glimpse inside it during what many would consider the country's darkest hour in modern times. You'll hear and see his feelings on the hunt for Osama bin Laden, the war on terror and its ""enhanced interrogation"" methods he says were not torture and saved lives. Pressed by Pelley to explain why, if it wasn't torture,  these individuals had to have their interrogations ""enhanced,"" Tenet, leans forward to respond, ""Because these are people who will never, ever, ever tell you a thing. These are people who know who's responsible for the next terrorist attack....[who] wouldn't blink an eyelash about killing you, your family, me and my family and everybody in this town.""          Watch  An Excerpt Of Pelley's Report.     With the questions still hovering over the massacre at Virginia Tech last week, correspondent Steve Kroft explores perhaps the biggest irony in the horrible event. It's the fact that Seung-Hui Cho, with a history of mental illness, was still able to purchase the guns he used to kill 32 innocent people, despite a 40-year-old federal law prohibiting the sale of guns to the mentally ill. Kroft reports that the law isn't enforced because many states have laws that protect the privacy of the mentally ill, advocates for whom still want their records sealed and not shared with other government agencies. Even the NRA won't go that far. The sad fact is that Cho wasn't the first mentally ill person to kill with a gun he purchased freely, nor will he be likely the last.     Watch  Kroft's Reporter's Notebook.     These stories and some interesting items from Andy Rooney's mail bag, this Sunday, April 29, on 60 Minutes at 7 p.m. ET/PT.

phishing,legitimate,True,"Personal Offer. REPUBLIC OF ZAMBIA, OVERSEAS TASK FORCE ON FOREIGN PAYMENTS NO. 34 CLEMENCE ROAD, EDMONTON N12 QPY LONDON  Good day,  Forgive this unusual manner of contacting you, but this particular letter is of exceptional and very private nature.  I am  Richard Akintunde, the Secretary/Legal Adviser of the Zambia Overseas Task Force on Foreign Payments. The Task Force was set up by President LEVY MWANAWASA of Zambia on January, 2004 with the definite assignment of verifying/ratifying all claims for settlements made by Foreign Contractors and hence effecting Payments accordingly. Our terms of reference include all Contracts executed between 1991 and 2001 when Dr. Frederick Chiluba was the President. Former President Chiluba is currently standing trial for embezzlement of public fund while in office. President MWANAWASA had to launch a far-reaching anti-corruption campaign. All the Contracts (Foreign and Indigenous) awarded under the tenure of Chiluba are being reviewed now, as there were many bogus claims. However, some claims are legitimate. At the moment, we know precisely, the Claims that are legitimate and otherwise. As soon as we concluded our review, verifications and ratifications in Lusaka, Zambia,President MWANAWASA man  dated the Task Force to   In the course of doing our work  reviewing and scrutinizing, we discovered many bogus claims. In deed, we want to pay a sum being a bogus claim into the Account of a relaible and honest person (personal or company) who will be fronted as a Foreign Contractor that satisfactorily executed a contract during Chilubas tenure. We have the instruments to create a perfect semblance of genuineness; hence the transaction will be hitch-free, risk free and quite beneficial to all parties involved. I want you to receive this money as the beneficiary. I will need ultimately; your full name and address to commence work that will culminate in your being recognized as the Foreign Contractor and beneficiary of fund, your private telephone and fax numbers to enhance communication and occupation . I will also need a reassurance that you have the capacity to do this transaction (receive this money) without raising eyebrows. You will be adequately compensated for your assistance. It will take about two weeks to conclude this transaction. I will inform you the details and modus operandi when you reply. I implore you to accord it the confidentiality it deserves. Expecting your urgent and positive response, as we have limited time to carry out our assignment in London before going back to Zambia.   Whatever your actions and your decision, I thank you for taking the time to read my email.  Regards   Richard Akintunde",1

phishing,legitimate,True,"Urgent Business Proposal Kenya Commercial Bank City Centre,  P.O. Box 44252,Nairobi. Kenya  Email:dan@danielm.org   Dear Sir/Madam,   May I crave your indulgence to open this business discussion with you by an informal letter of this sort. It  is pertinent that a business of this magnitude should have commenced properly with a formal meeting  between you and us to enable both parties know ourselves, have a fore knowledge of the nature of the  business, discuss and acquaint ourselves with the responsibilities and functions of both parties and  appropriate shares accordingly.  I am Dan Wilson Branch Manager of Kenya Commercial Bank in Kenya.This is an urgent and very  confidential business proposition.   On June 6, 2001,a Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the Kenya Ministry Of Energy,  Mr.Clifford Stone made a numbered time(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at  US$21,500,000.00,(Twenty-One Million, five hundred thousand Dollars) in my branch.  Upon maturity,I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month,we  sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers,the National Petroleum  Corporation that Mr.Clifford Stone died from an automobile accident.   On further investigation,I found out that he died without making a WILL,and all attempts to trace his next  of kin was fruitless.   I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.Clifford Stone did not declare any kin or  relations in all his official documents,including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of  US$21,500,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward  to claim it. According to South African Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the  ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.   Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money  which was fixed deposited in my bank. I am writing you because I as a public servant,i cannot operate a  foreign account.   I want to present you as the owner of the funds so you can be able to claim them with the help of my  attorney. This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately your telephone number,full names and  address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the  beneficiary of the funds.   The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 80% for me and 20% for you.The paperwork  for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantees the successful execution of this  transaction.   If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email and Upon your response,I shall then provide  you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.   Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable  for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country.   Due to the nature of confidentiality in this Transaction our communication can only be via email and fax  mostly.   Awaiting your urgent reply via my private email:   Thanks and my regards.   Dan Wilson  Branch Manager  Kenya Commercial Bank",1

I agree with some of the above, but it's also true that there is no  requirement on anyone to respond to any particular posting, and you are  likely to get more responses if you do identify yourself.  If you don't,  there's always the possibility that you are a student asking us to do  your homework for you, or that you really should hire someone to do your  programming. My response may have seemed rude, but I thought at the time that it  would have been more rude to ignore the question completely.  In my  judgment the original answer was sufficient, and the followups showed  that Mr./Ms. Anonymous wasn't willing to put a reasonable effort into  solving the problem her/himself.

legitimate,phishing,True,"[sugar] Fwd: OLPC Nepal looking for Volunteers for this Summer ---------- Forwarded message ---------- From: Bryan Berry  Date: May 3, 2007 6:54 AM Subject: OLPC Nepal looking for Volunteers for this Summer To: devel@laptop.org, games@laptop.org, olpc-open@laptop.org   from: http://olpcnepal.blogspot.com/2007/05/were-looking-for-volunteers-for-this.html  As you may read in the previous Post "" An Amazing Educator,"" a fantastic educator has joined our group. We are looking to work with her very intensely this summer to implement many of her existing learning activities and add as many cool activities as we can. In the fall we plan to visit many, many schools to figure out how kids and teachers react to these materials.  Right now we have three full-time volunteer developers, all of them Nepali. We would love four (4) foreign volunteers to come work with us this summer in Kathmandu. We will pair each foreign volunteer with a Nepali intern. That should bring our content strike force to 11 people. That would really help us to advance OLPC in Nepal.  Requirements: We are looking for experienced programmers. Your age and # of university degrees are less important to us than your passion for software development. We seek individuals with significant software development experience on Linux, ideally in Python, PyGames, C, etc. You should have already run the OLPC image in an emulator.  You should expect to stay in Nepal for a minimum of 6 weeks. You can stay a maximum of 5 months due to Nepal's complex visa rules. If your application is selected, you can start as soon as you can get here.  Compensation: We are prepared to offer a generous salary package of $0 per month, reimburse you for a full 0% of your airplane ticket cost, and offer no health plan. We don't have any $ :) Our office, bandwidth, and computers have all been donated. We can offer comfortable lodging for a total of four volunteers. We can accept additional volunteers if they are willing to find and pay for their own accommodation.  We can offer you an opportunity to work w/ a very passionate team of engineers on one of the most exciting projects in the world. If you are interested please send an e-mail with your C.V. and a brief description of what you have done w/ OLPC so far to bryan at olpcnepal dot org  Unfortunately, summer is monsoon season so Nepal aweseome trekking isn't a good idea. Still, it's been a weird year weather-wise. We'll try to get you out for a trek near the end of the summer.  We'll take you running/hiking in the hills surrounding Kathmandu if you are so inclined and subject you to Ankur's bad jokes (and they are very bad).  The Work: You will work closely with our lead developers Shankar, Ankur, and Himali Kiran and our lead educator Christine Stone. You will help implement a series of activities based on PyGame and/or GCompris. That means writing a lot of Python, possibly some C, working with sound libraries, and more. If you have some exciting ideas for power management or mesh networking, we may find some time to work on them w/ you. However, you should expect to spend most of your time building Sugar activities, getting feedback from Christine, revising, showing to kids and teachers, repeat.  We will expect you to train the Nepali intern assigned to you. The intern will most likely be an undergraduate computer science student.  The development team will frequently interact with kids and teachers over the course of the summer.  We intend to recruit education volunteers at a later date. I'll save that for a future blog entry.  --  Bryan W.

My understanding of this is as follows:  In the event of bankruptcy, employees are guaranteed to be paid for work already completed up to an amount of $4650 (If the company were to file next week, this amount should be small since payday was today).  In addition, employees are paid for hours worked after bankruptcy at their normal salary or an amount the judge determines and such payments are not capped at $4650.      -----Original Message----- From: 	Enron Announcements/Corp/Enron@ENRON   On Behalf Of Ken Lay - Office of the Chairman@ENRON Sent:	Friday, November 30, 2001 5:58 PM To:	All Enron Employees United States Group@ENRON Subject:	UPDATE - Reporting to Work Next Week   Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today.  We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.  I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.  We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.  While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.  I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.  Ken",0

Iraqi insurgents joined 10,000 U.S. troops in the offensive and took control of several areas north of Baghdad today. David Martin will have the latest.     And our chief foreign correspondent Lara Logan will update us on the orphanage story she reported on Monday. She'll give us some encouraging news about how the once-neglected Baghdad orphans are doing now.      Back in the United States, a South Carolina community is beginning the process of mourning nine firefighters who died in massive furniture factory blaze. Tonight, Kelly Cobiella will share the story of one man who escaped from the inferno.      And there's extraordinary new animation that shows more clearly than we've seen before why the World Trade Center towers collapsed on 9/11 after being hit by airplanes.     What if a Web site could tell you that going to one hospital in your area rather than another could dramatically improve your odds of survival? Now, one has been set up by the U.S. government. Wyatt Andrews will give you all the details.     Finally, it's been 35 years since the Watergate scandal drove former President Richard Nixon out of office. Now historians at the National Archives are poring over his speeches, gifts and recordings - yes, even that 18  minutes of blank tape - for installation at the Nixon Library. Richard Schlesinger will take us inside the vault for a fascinating history lesson.

Pat said that to post it in the Energy Sense format (MDEF) would be very difficult because of how the system operates.   Pat also confirmed that they do not post data from all MV90 accounts to the MDMA on a daily basis.  I asked her if they could change this process and she said that it was something they have been wanting to do, but it has not been a high priority.   I recommend that we get the daily CSV file from the FTP server and import it into the Load Database that John Rutledge is developing.  Pat says that if we can have the Work Request completed today, we could have this set up next week.

Now, in the continuing economic    downturn,  foreign  workers  are  being  blamed  for  displacing their    homegrown counterparts.     Wednesday,  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., will introduce a bill crafted    to  close  loopholes  in  employment  visa  laws,  which he says allow    companies  to  hire  foreign  employees  and  outsource  them to other    companies.     ADVERTISEMENT     IFRAME:    http://ad.doubleclick.net/adi/eweek.dart/news;sz=336x280;ord=456641793    3?    [news;abr=!ie;sz=336x280;ord=4566417933?]      [ew_spacer.gif]     ""We must make sure that our immigration policies don't have a backlash    effect  on displacing American workers,"" Chambliss said Tuesday. ""[The    bill]  will  end the practice of companies who are displacing American    workers.""     The  Senate  Judiciary  Committee  Tuesday  took a look at the role of    temporary work visas in the current economy. The technology industry's    use  of  H-1B  visas  dropped approximately 75 percent last year, with    initial  H-1B visa applications falling to 26,659 in 2002 from 105,692    in  2001,  according  to the Department of Homeland Security Office of    Immigration Security.     Despite  the  statistics,  as unemployment rises in the United States,    lawmakers are hearing from their constituents.     ""I  cannot  tell  you  how  many  workers  came up to me [in August in    California]  and  said, 'I've been replaced by somebody I trained, and    they're  getting  a  third  [the  salary] of what I got,'"" Sen. Dianne    Feinstein,  D-Calif.,  said  at  a  hearing  of  the  Senate Judiciary    Committee  Tuesday. ""Wherever I go, this program comes up and somebody    tells me they've been replaced, and they are angry.""     Intel  Corp.,  which  employs close to 80,000 workers worldwide, hires    individuals  through  the  H1-B  visa program when a position requires    unique  or  difficult-to-find  skills,  Patrick Duffy, human resources    attorney  at Intel, told lawmakers. Beginning in 2001, Intel decreased    hiring  overall,  but  it  continues  to  hire H-1B applicants when it    cannot  find  qualified  U.S.  workers,  Duffy  said.  The company has    particular difficulty hiring U.S. citizens for positions in electrical    engineering design and chemical engineering, he said.     Duffy  contended  that  the  H-1B  visa program does not displace U.S.    workers  and  ultimately  benefits  the  U.S.  economy.  Most  of  the    company's  H-1B visa employees studied at U.S. universities and earned    masters degrees and doctorates.     ""These are not temporary workers to us. The H-1B visa is just one step    in  making these workers U.S. workers,"" Duffy said. ""Hopefully they'll    stay with Intel ... the rest of their lives.""     Large  corporations  that  rely  on skilled foreign workers are urging    Congress  not  to pass short-term fixes that will later cause problems    when  the  economy  recovers.  In  the  boom  times  of the late '90s,    Ingersoll-Rand  Corp. had to take people off the payroll when the H-1B    hiring  cap  was  lowered,  Elizabeth Dickson, adviser for Immigration    Services  at  Ingersoll-Rand  in  Woodcliff Lake, N.J., told lawmakers    Tuesday.     ""When  the [foreign worker hiring] cap reverts to 65,000, we are going    to  have a lot of problems that we experienced both in 1997 and 1998,""    Dickson  said.  ""If  we  have a recovering economy, what are our needs    going to be long term?""     The  root of the problem, according to the industry officials, is that    Americans  earn too few graduate degrees in the hard sciences, leaving    the  domestic  pool of adequate engineering specializations too small.    Contrary  to some assertions, industry officials said they do not hire    foreign  workers  to  pay  them  less  than  they would pay Americans.    Dickson  told  lawmakers  that  it  is  more expensive to hire foreign    workers.     ""We  are  mostly  looking  to  hire U.S. workers. They're cheaper, and    there  are  a  lot  less problems,"" Dickson said. ""In the near term we    simply must have access to foreign nationals. If we want to maintain a    global edge, we want to have the best and the brightest working for us    in the United States.""     American  engineers  argue  that corporate America's use of H-1B visas    exacerbates the problem of engineering unemployment. Abuse of the visa    program,  in  particular,  leaves  qualified  Americans  out  of work,    according  to  John  Steadman,  president-elect  of  the  IEEE-USA  in    Washington, D.C.     ""If  we  continue  down  this path, the United States is making itself    increasingly  dependent  of foreign technical expertise, both here and    abroad,""  Steadman  told  lawmakers,  urging the government to support    programs  that  encourage  more  students--especially  minorities  and    women--to go into the sciences.",0

The paper is available on the Publications page of my website, www.EHirst.com << File: http://www.ehirst.com/ >> . Please let me know if you have any comments on the paper. Here is a summary of the paper:         California was supposed to show the rest of the nation a brighter electricity future. That future, as outlined by the California Public Utilities Commission in 1994, envisioned an electricity industry featuring competitive markets. Such markets were intended to produce lower costs and more choices for consumers, while ensuring profits for efficient energy suppliers and encouraging the retirement of old, inefficient power plants.         Although the first two years of restructuring (beginning in April 1998) seemed to bear out these promises, the last year has been a disaster for California's electricity consumers, taxpayers, and electric utilities. Part of the fallout from California's electricity crisis is considerable concern-even opposition-in other states to restructuring the electricity industry.          Although a few states have decided, based on the California experience, not to restructure, I believe that is the wrong outcome. Instead, the primary lessons other states should learn from California are that competitive markets can work; competition is not to blame for California's problems; and basic economic principles of supply, demand, and prices affect market outcomes.         Section 2 of this paper briefly reviews the history of electricity regulation and restructuring in California and the problems that occurred beginning in May 2000. Section 3, the heart of this paper, offers guidance to other states on the key ingredients of a competitive electricity industry. This section makes several points:   Maintain a favorable investment and regulatory climate for new generation to ensure that enough generation capacity is online and planned to meet growing loads.   Ensure that enough infrastructure (transmission capacity and natural gas pipeline capacity) is in place and planned to meet growing loads, maintain reliability, connect new generators to the grid, support large regional markets, and provide fuel to power plants.   Encourage retail customers to participate in dynamic-pricing and voluntary-load-reduction programs (i.e., couple retail and wholesale markets).   Create honest retail competition: avoid standard-offer rates with artificial discounts and create conditions that encourage many companies to offer retail services without favoring individual competitors.   Encourage electricity suppliers to manage and diversify their supply and price risks.   Create efficient and integrated wholesale markets for energy, ancillary services, and transmission congestion.   Monitor and minimize horizontal market power (generation) and vertical market power (combined ownership and operation of generation and transmission).           Ultimately, competitive markets for electricity will lower costs and prices, better align consumer prices with producer costs, improve producer efficiency in both investment and operation, maintain or improve reliability, and yield greater innovation in customer services and pricing options.          But, this transition from one industry structure to another is turning out to be long and complicated. It is complicated because electricity is so important to our modern, high-tech society; electricity is our most flexible fuel, providing light, heat, motive power, and the energy to operate all our electronic equipment. Also, electricity truly is a real-time product for which production and consumption must occur at the same time.          Although the problems that have occurred in California are substantial and worrisome, regulators and legislators in other states should focus on the long-term benefits of competitive electricity markets and accept the possible short-term problems that may occur. They also need to recognize that wholesale markets are regional in scope and extend far beyond the boundaries of any single state. Finally, competition in retail and wholesale markets must be coordinated; in particular, it is not possible to have competitive wholesale markets unless at least some retail load faces time varying prices.          If states restructure properly to create competitive markets for wholesale energy and retail services, we should all benefit. Consumers will enjoy lower prices, they will have many more choices of energy services and price-risk tradeoffs, reliability will be improved because most reliability services will be obtained through markets instead of by engineering edict, and the financial risks associated with building and operating power plants will be assigned properly to investors rather than consumers.

Seven Republicans voted against the proposal, while three Democrats voted in favor. Rep. Johnson (R-Conn.) says the bill, sponsored by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Thomas (R-Calif.), would put $9 billion into state coffers within 10 days of enactment.  The bill would allow states to use the funds to pay regular unemployment benefits, increase benefit payments, extend benefits beyond 26 weeks, expand benefit eligibility, or for administrative purposes. The bill also would extend the work opportunity tax credit and the welfare-to-work tax credit through Dec. 31, 2003, and contains provisions to boost the Social Services Block Grant program by $3 billion so that states can give health coverage to the unemployed. Critics of the bill--including congressional Democrats, labor, and civil rights groups--claim the measure will not accomplish the Republicans' stated goals of stimulating the economy and getting displaced workers back on the job. A substitute measure offered by House Democrats is rejected by a vote of 261-166. Senate Majority Leader Daschle (D-S.D.) tells reporters that he hopes the Senate will be able to pass its own version of an economic stimulus bill before Thanksgiving. . . .

First Unum Life Ins. Co., ""Ark., No. 00-1430, 10/18/01). Reversing summary judgment for First Unum Life Insurance Co., the supreme court holds that because both the insurer and James Elam submitted evidence outside of the insurance policy to support their interpretations of the term ""mental illness,"" the issue is a question of fact for a jury to decide. The policy defines mental illness as ""mental, nervous or emotional diseases or disorders of any type."" Arguing the term is ambiguous, Elam says bipolar affective disorder is a physical illness with a biological origin that is treated with medication. . . .

Lake County Sewer Co., ""6th Cir., No. 00-00228, 10/17/01). In addition to seeking unpaid wages under the FLSA after his discharge, Donald Martin charged his former employer, Lake County Sewer Co., with violating the terms of its collective bargaining agreement with a Teamsters local in violation of LMRA Section 301. Martin also contended that the union violated its duty of fair representation under Section 301 by failing to pursue a grievance against Lake for allegedly improper deductions in his benefits and pay. Martin argues his FLSA claim is distinct from the Section 301 claim and therefore governed by the wage law's two-year limitations period. According to the Sixth Circuit, however, Martin's charge relating to the unpaid wages was based on the provision in the collective bargaining agreement governing compensation and must be resolved in accordance with LMRA procedures. . . .

Ulster County, ""N.D. N.Y., No. 99-CV-1278, 10/10/01). Rejecting a summary judgment motion by Ulster County Golden Hill Health Care Center, Judge Homer of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York finds that Gail Becker established enough evidence to go to trial on her claims of sexual harassment based on a hostile work environment and retaliation under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and other laws. Her evidence surrounding the assault incident--including her supervisor's failure to allow Becker to call the police and the facility's refusal to allow her time off to seek a protective order--if credited, ""establishes an incident sufficient by itself to support a finding that the conditions of her employment were irrevocably altered as a result and that those conditions became abusive,"" the court holds. . . .

Now, in the continuing economic    downturn,  foreign  workers  are  being  blamed  for  displacing their    homegrown counterparts.     Wednesday,  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., will introduce a bill crafted    to  close  loopholes  in  employment  visa  laws,  which he says allow    companies  to  hire  foreign  employees  and  outsource  them to other    companies.     ADVERTISEMENT     IFRAME:    http://ad.doubleclick.net/adi/eweek.dart/news;sz=336x280;ord=456641793    3?    [news;abr=!ie;sz=336x280;ord=4566417933?]      [ew_spacer.gif]     ""We must make sure that our immigration policies don't have a backlash    effect  on displacing American workers,"" Chambliss said Tuesday. ""[The    bill]  will  end the practice of companies who are displacing American    workers.""     The  Senate  Judiciary  Committee  Tuesday  took a look at the role of    temporary work visas in the current economy. The technology industry's    use  of  H-1B  visas  dropped approximately 75 percent last year, with    initial  H-1B visa applications falling to 26,659 in 2002 from 105,692    in  2001,  according  to the Department of Homeland Security Office of    Immigration Security.     Despite  the  statistics,  as unemployment rises in the United States,    lawmakers are hearing from their constituents.     ""I  cannot  tell  you  how  many  workers  came up to me [in August in    California]  and  said, 'I've been replaced by somebody I trained, and    they're  getting  a  third  [the  salary] of what I got,'"" Sen. Dianne    Feinstein,  D-Calif.,  said  at  a  hearing  of  the  Senate Judiciary    Committee  Tuesday. ""Wherever I go, this program comes up and somebody    tells me they've been replaced, and they are angry.""     Intel  Corp.,  which  employs close to 80,000 workers worldwide, hires    individuals  through  the  H1-B  visa program when a position requires    unique  or  difficult-to-find  skills,  Patrick Duffy, human resources    attorney  at Intel, told lawmakers. Beginning in 2001, Intel decreased    hiring  overall,  but  it  continues  to  hire H-1B applicants when it    cannot  find  qualified  U.S.  workers,  Duffy  said.  The company has    particular difficulty hiring U.S. citizens for positions in electrical    engineering design and chemical engineering, he said.     Duffy  contended  that  the  H-1B  visa program does not displace U.S.    workers  and  ultimately  benefits  the  U.S.  economy.  Most  of  the    company's  H-1B visa employees studied at U.S. universities and earned    masters degrees and doctorates.     ""These are not temporary workers to us. The H-1B visa is just one step    in  making these workers U.S. workers,"" Duffy said. ""Hopefully they'll    stay with Intel ... the rest of their lives.""     Large  corporations  that  rely  on skilled foreign workers are urging    Congress  not  to pass short-term fixes that will later cause problems    when  the  economy  recovers.  In  the  boom  times  of the late '90s,    Ingersoll-Rand  Corp. had to take people off the payroll when the H-1B    hiring  cap  was  lowered,  Elizabeth Dickson, adviser for Immigration    Services  at  Ingersoll-Rand  in  Woodcliff Lake, N.J., told lawmakers    Tuesday.     ""When  the [foreign worker hiring] cap reverts to 65,000, we are going    to  have a lot of problems that we experienced both in 1997 and 1998,""    Dickson  said.  ""If  we  have a recovering economy, what are our needs    going to be long term?""     The  root of the problem, according to the industry officials, is that    Americans  earn too few graduate degrees in the hard sciences, leaving    the  domestic  pool of adequate engineering specializations too small.    Contrary  to some assertions, industry officials said they do not hire    foreign  workers  to  pay  them  less  than  they would pay Americans.    Dickson  told  lawmakers  that  it  is  more expensive to hire foreign    workers.     ""We  are  mostly  looking  to  hire U.S. workers. They're cheaper, and    there  are  a  lot  less problems,"" Dickson said. ""In the near term we    simply must have access to foreign nationals. If we want to maintain a    global edge, we want to have the best and the brightest working for us    in the United States.""     American  engineers  argue  that corporate America's use of H-1B visas    exacerbates the problem of engineering unemployment. Abuse of the visa    program,  in  particular,  leaves  qualified  Americans  out  of work,    according  to  John  Steadman,  president-elect  of  the  IEEE-USA  in    Washington, D.C.     ""If  we  continue  down  this path, the United States is making itself    increasingly  dependent  of foreign technical expertise, both here and    abroad,""  Steadman  told  lawmakers,  urging the government to support    programs  that  encourage  more  students--especially  minorities  and    women--to go into the sciences.",0

legitimate,phishing,True,"[Ip-health] USA for Innovation letter to Congress http://www.usaforinnovation.org/news/050907_USAFI_Adelman%20Letter.pdf  Ambassador Kenneth L. Adelman, Executive Director USA For Innovation P.O. Box 57052 Washington, DC 20037-7052  May 9, 2007  Members of Congress United States of America  Dear Member of Congress:  I wish to bring to your immediate attention the recent attacks on American intellectual property being perpetrated by Brazil and Thailand. These attacks endanger the basis of American prosperity, innovation, and jobs. Unless vigorous measures are taken soon, such attacks are likely to spread to other countries, to the further detriment of U.S. national interests.  Last Friday, Brazils President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva issued a ""compulsory license"" to override the U.S. patent on an AIDS drug made by Merck. Obviously, this measure undercuts future research and development on medical innovation, upon which the health of millions around the world depend.  The public rationale given by the governments of Thailand and Brazil to override the property rights of foreign firms is invalid. Issuing a compulsory license in this manner is considered by USA for Innovation to be illegitimate under World Trade Organization rules, indisputably bad policy, and dangerous precedent.  When Brazil and Thailand issue compulsory licenses, they signal to the world their unwillingness to respect international patent protection. If this grows into more of a trend  which it will, unless strongly resisted -- innovators will no longer choose to provide life-saving drugs and other medicines in these countries.  Moreover, such a move is short-sighted for the countries themselves. It hurts local firms in Brazil and Thailand trying to attract foreign investment. It hurts their patients, who will no longer have access to patented medicines which, in many cases, are the only treatments proven safe and effective.  Thailand and Brazil have no excuse for their behavior. They are not poor countries, and cannot claim to be in crisis. Thailands GDP ranks it among the top 10% wealthiest countries in the world, and its government spends little on health care. The World Health Organization notes that Thailand spends far less on health care (3.3% of GDP) than peers such as Argentina (8.9%) or poorer countries like Cambodia (10.9%) or Lebanon (10.2%). The United States spends 15.2%.  What is true in Thailand is even truer of Brazil. It is not only in the top 10% of richest countries in the world, but in the top 5%. While Brazil spends a greater percentage of its GDP on health (7.6%) than Thailand, it is still half of what America spends.  In attacking intellectual property rights of American and European companies, Brazil and Thailand threaten innovation, which is the lifeblood of our economy. In this age of globalization, U.S. intellectual property is our comparative advantage.  A 2005 study by two leading economists  the Democratic, Clinton-appointee Dr. Robert Shapiro and Republican advisor Dr. Kevin Hassett -- estimates that U.S. intellectual property is worth between $5 trillion and $5.5 trillion. This equals approximately 45% of the U.S. GDP, and is greater than the GDP of any other nation in the world.  Intellectual property accounts for about one-quarter of all business investment over the last decade. Intangibles now account for nearly two-thirds of the market value of large U.S. public companies.  As importantly, nearly 3 million American jobs depend on continued investment in biopharmaceuticals. The world benefits from the life-saving results produced by these American scientists, researchers, doctors and teachers. More than 70% of all world medicines are created by Americans. International refusal to pay for these products not only threatens millions of American jobs, it endangers our ability to produce the new medical treatments the ailing around the world need most desperately.  Both Brazil and Thailand enjoy extraordinary benefits from Americans. While American workers face expensive tariffs when exporting goods and services to these countries (including, incredibly, taxes and tariffs on medical products), both Brazil and Thailand receive generous treatment when sending their products to the U.S. under the Generalized System of Preferences.  Both countries also receive a host of military, humanitarian and other forms of assistance from the U.S. government, in addition to private donations from millions of American charities. It seems appropriate to remind leaders of these countries that the United States will protect innovation-producing American firms and jobs. Doing so now, in a vigorous manner, will save lives in these countries and throughout the world.  Sincerely yours,  Kenneth L.

legitimate,phishing,True,"Re: What are you talking about $1600? NO I'AM NOT GOING TO PAY 61.00. PLEASE EXAMINE THE ATTACHMENT AND YOU'LL SEE WHY ----- Original Message ----- From: ""Love, Phillip M.""  To:  Sent: Tuesday, January 22, 2002 7:30 AM Subject: What are you talking about $1600? I have you down for $61 plus shipping, not $1,600.  I show that you bid at $6.99 and at $61.  There was no bid for $19.99 listed at all.  I am sorry if you did not mean to bid $61, but it is hardly out of the range - these balls were selling this weekend for $80-90.  If your winning bid was $200 or higher I could understand your complaint and we could make an adjustment, but $61 is not an unreasonable amount.  Please let me know if you are planning on paying the $61(I will pay shipping if you use PayPal).  If not, I need to contact EBay for resolution.  I need a response as soon as possible.  Thanks.

But former CIA Director George Tenet lets loose in our first story in a public venting rare for any public official, never mind a CIA director. Tenet angrily accuses the Bush administration of ruining his reputation by misusing his now-famous ""slam dunk"" remark about Iraqi WMD to justify its march to war. ""It's the most despicable thing that ever happened to me,"" Tenet says. ""You don't do this. You don't throw somebody overboard just because it's a deflection. Is that honorable? It's not honorable to me,"" he tells correspondent Scott Pelley.  He also reveals in this double-length segment his anguish and frustration over the 9/11 attack, the first of the president's inner circle to provide a glimpse inside it during what many would consider the country's darkest hour in modern times. You'll hear and see his feelings on the hunt for Osama bin Laden, the war on terror and its ""enhanced interrogation"" methods he says were not torture and saved lives. Pressed by Pelley to explain why, if it wasn't torture,  these individuals had to have their interrogations ""enhanced,"" Tenet, leans forward to respond, ""Because these are people who will never, ever, ever tell you a thing. These are people who know who's responsible for the next terrorist attack....[who] wouldn't blink an eyelash about killing you, your family, me and my family and everybody in this town.""          Watch  An Excerpt Of Pelley's Report.     With the questions still hovering over the massacre at Virginia Tech last week, correspondent Steve Kroft explores perhaps the biggest irony in the horrible event. It's the fact that Seung-Hui Cho, with a history of mental illness, was still able to purchase the guns he used to kill 32 innocent people, despite a 40-year-old federal law prohibiting the sale of guns to the mentally ill. Kroft reports that the law isn't enforced because many states have laws that protect the privacy of the mentally ill, advocates for whom still want their records sealed and not shared with other government agencies. Even the NRA won't go that far. The sad fact is that Cho wasn't the first mentally ill person to kill with a gun he purchased freely, nor will he be likely the last.     Watch  Kroft's Reporter's Notebook.     These stories and some interesting items from Andy Rooney's mail bag, this Sunday, April 29, on 60 Minutes at 7 p.m. ET/PT.

legitimate,phishing,True,"re : transitional assignments all i have received a few notes about this since this one but i will try to respond to all questions here . please see below responses in red : enron capital sally - husband and 3 children - ages 15 , 11 and 2 ) . i understand that the houses which have been vacated due to returning expats have all been filled , so can you have someone arrange for corporate housing that will accommodate them ? i think the best way to go here is for us to use serviced apartments as it will be very difficult to find a lease for such a short period for this type of accommodation . my assistant , lisa , has put a call in to a service who can help us find serviced accommodation in south kensington / chelsea area or in dolphin square where we have people now who are very satisfied . is there a reason you are partial to south kensington / chelsea ? what if we find accommodation in another nice area of london within a short commute to the office ? when i have some options , i will let you know , probably on monday . immigration - due to the fact that they will be traveling back and forth and have made trips already , i feel it would be best to apply for work permits versus using the visa waiver . i have sent them the forms and requested that brent complete his and file immediately to increase chances of getting his sometime shortly after he arrives in the uk . i have informed him that he should arrive without his family if the permit has not been received by april 1 . brent ' s work permit will be submitted today and we may receive if before april lst , but it is unlikely . the way it works for this is as follows : brent will receive the work permit from us and if he is here , he will have to leave the uk and enter with the work permit for it to be validated . if his family are in houston , they will need to receive entry clearance in the us prior to arriving in the uk . this takes approx 7 working days and they will require either brent ' s original passport and work permit or a certified copy of each along with other things such as marriage and birth certificates . if brent decides to bring his family with him to london prior to receiving the work permit , they must say they are coming on a vacation for a short period of time and have a return ticket to back it up . once the permit is received , the family can either travel back to houston and submit the entry clearance visas there or they can all travel to amsterdam where they are currenlty issuing entry clearance without a problem . there is always a small element of risk in going to amsterdam , however , as do not have to issue the stamps there , they just do it because they are nice ! work permits are arriving approx 4 weeks from date of submission . we can discuss all of this on the 20 th . tax - please confirm whether paye will need to be paid for them during the short term assignment and then reclaimed through a treaty benefit . paye is due after 60 days ; however , if brent and sally are really only going to be here for approx 75 days , i am not going to inform the revenue that they are here . if this extends beyond the set time , we can look at options but the only responsiblility that brent and sally will have is to ensure they complete the tax organiser in order for us to get the tax back . also , as we would have to apply the treaty here , we need to ensure the salary costs stay in houston . jane , have you discussed this point ? benefits - i have suggested that they remain on us domestic payroll and benefits and , if medical claims arise that exceed what they would have spent in the us , they may claim the excess on the expense report . agreed . per diem - we need to discuss the appropriate amount based on family size . jane , please call me to discuss . i have left you a message , thanks let me know of any other issues we need to address . as always , i appreciate your help . jane",0

legitimate,phishing,True,"RE: Operational Risk Management Rick,  I am nominating Rakesh Bharati to serve on the Operational Risk Committee.  Vince   -----Original Message----- From: 	Heathman, Karen K.   On Behalf Of Buy, Rick Sent:	Tuesday, October 02, 2001 11:26 AM To:	Causey, Richard; Beck, Sally; Pickering, Mark; Gorte, David; Dyson, Fernley; Jordan, Mike; Colwell, Wes; Kaminski, Vince J; 'thomas.h.bauer@us.andersen.com' Cc:	Kilchrist, Shawn; Bharati, Rakesh; Walker, Mark A.; 'john.e.sorrells@us.andersen.com' Subject:	Operational Risk Management   As you are all aware, the latest Risk Management Policy specifically addresses Operational Risk, and more specifically commits Enron to develop systems and processes that enable Enron to better evaluate its operational risk.  To that end, I have asked Wanda Curry to lead a cross-functional team (the ""Operational Risk Committee""), which will be jointly accountable for meeting this commitment. I would like to have representatives from Enron Assurance Services, RAC, Research, Information Technology, GRMO and Arthur Anderson.    Enron's primary objective for monitoring its exposure to operational risk is to (a) identify the derivation of operational risk exposures and (b) improve the Company's systems and processes to mitigate such risk. The guidelines for operational risk assessment are essentially undeveloped.  It will be our challenge to identify, assess, categorize, quantify and mitigate exposure to operational risk.     The risk capital allocation process includes the consideration of operational risk.  Initially, this assessment will be based on a qualitative view of the business unit's internal processes, people and systems. The initial goal, for completion prior to year-end 2001, is to establish a baseline and/or report card to convey a sense for where we are now.  It is Enron's objective, as reflected in the Risk Management Policy, to increase the sophistication of risk measurement for operational risks through documented qualitative assessments and quantitative measurements.    A list of additional objectives to be addressed by the cross functional team has been prepared by Wanda.  These include: 	 Develop a qualitative operational risk assessment approach and implement.  This approach should enable a quick review of key functions and standards to identify weaknesses, monitor progress over time, and provide management with a representation of operational risk. Assess and improve integrity of daily risk reports, i.e. require confirmation that all books are captured, aggregated and processed through RisktRAC, CreditAg, and Infinity applications Ascertain the extent of spreadsheet usage across Enron and develop the ability to monitor NOP, V@R, and MTM for spreadsheets separately, i.e. a Spreadsheet DPR.  Work with GRMO to develop ""rules of use"" for financial valuation models and spreadsheet ""books"" Utilize the existing RMS database and develop the ability to monitor intercompany - interbook activity (initially for forward positions only) and report variances  Recommend metrics for quantitative measurement of operational risk Access need for additional or improved risk databases  Wanda will be contacting each of you to identify your designated operational risk contact that will participate on this cross-functional team.    Thanks,  Rick Buy",0

legitimate,phishing,True,"[Ip-health] Economist: Drugs firms are rethinking their business model  http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9409230  Beyond the blockbuster Drugs firms are rethinking their business model   LIPITOR is a drugs company's dream. The cholesterol pill made by Pfizer, an American pharmaceuticals giant, is the world's best-selling drug. Last year it earned over $13 billion in revenues. Other hugely successful drugs include GlaxoSmithKline's Advair, an asthma remedy, and Plavix, a blood thinner, which is sold by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Sanofi-Aventis. Both enjoy billions of dollars in annual sales. Despite such rewards, however, pharmaceutical companies are reconsidering their pursuit of blockbuster drugs, as new technology permits the creation of niche remedies that target rare ailments or sub-populations of people suffering from common diseases.  That explains the $3 billion hostile takeover bid announced this week by Roche, a Swiss pharmaceutical firm, for Ventana Medical Systems, an American diagnostics firm. This year, Roche has gobbled up several diagnostics and genetic-testing firms making technologies that enhance the value of its targeted cancer therapies. The firm recently completed a $155m takeover of 454 Life Sciences, which makes gene-sequencing technology and last week spent some $273m on NimbleGen, which makes technologies used in identifying the genetic causes of disease.  Roche is being drawn away from conventional one-size-fits-all drugs partly by the allure of the lucrative new markets being created by the development of personalised medicine. But drugs giants are also victims of their own success. Blockbusters like Lipitor are already so effective, argues Tom Nagle of Monitor, a management consultancy, that it is difficult to come up with alternatives that are good enough to command a higher price.  Worse, many blockbusters are going off patent soon and pharmaceutical giants are finding it increasingly difficult to come up with new drugs to replace themdespite throwing pots of money at the problem (see chart). Makers of generic drugs are also growing more assertive in attacking patents. As a result of all this, reckons IMS, an industry consultancy, the industry saw a record $18 billion in branded sales collapse in 2006.  There are signs that long-term investors are growing concerned. A coalition of institutional investors representing over $1.1 trillion in assets, issued a report this month demanding a rethink of core business assumptions. Martin Eijgenhuijsen of ABP, a Dutch pension fund that is part of the coalition, says, We have serious doubts that the current business model can deliver targeted drugs. This requires radical change.  So is the industry ready to follow Roche's lead toward specialty products, targeted therapies and the like? The answer seems to be yes. Ray Hill of IMS calculates that although the vast mainstream market for chronic diseases like high blood pressure or diabetes is still important, specialty drugs accounted for nearly two thirds of total revenue growth last year, up from just a third in 2000. And only a quarter of drugs launched last year tackled chronic diseases, suggesting the pipeline is shifting toward targeted therapies.  For that trend, thank both technology and regulation. Anthony Farino of the consultancy arm of PricewaterhouseCoopers argues that such technologies as high-throughput sequencing, genomics and personal phenotyping, which were not available five years ago, are now transforming how drugs are discovered and tested. Ron Krall, GSK's chief medical officer, thinks the trick is identifying which patients will benefit most from new treatmentsor, equally usefully, which ones will have adverse reactions. To determine that, his firm has just opened a new facility in London run jointly with Imperial College and Hammersmith Hospital, where experimental drugs are tested. The micro-doses they administer to patients are analysed in real time by molecular scanners.  Regulators could play a decisive role in the large drugs companies' shifting strategies. The risk-averse stance they have taken since safety problems led Merck to recall its painkiller, Vioxx, may help propel the industry more rapidly away from blockbusters. Viren Mehta, an industry expert, speculates that although new drugs will always carry unknown risks, the regulatory burden might prove lighter for those aimed at specific, acute conditions (as opposed to ongoing maladies like diabetes). After all, he says, Fewer people are at risk for a shorter time.  Another regulatory boost may come from cost-benefit analysis that considers the long-term benefits, and not just the high price tags, of innovative new drugs. Britain's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has approved Herceptin, a targeted cancer drug, despite an annual cost per patient of nearly $50,000 because, in the words of Sir Michael Rawlins, NICE's chairman, it provides long-term value. NICE has also agreed to buy a cancer treatment made by Johnson & Johnson that has little effect on a third of patients, on the condition that it pay only when the drug works. And with an expensive Alzheimer's drug, the agency ruled that it would not pay for patients with the mildest form of dementia to take ita ruling that was challenged in a London court this week.  Such lawsuits are a sign that the transition to a new way of doing business carries risks. But as Graham Higson, head of regulatory affairs at AstraZeneca, a British drugs firm, notes: There's no such thing as no risk. The industry simply cannot continue developing drugs exactly the same way it has for 40 years. _______________________________________________ Ip-health mailing list Ip-health@lists.essential.org http://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health",0

My husband was assonated by president Mugabe and his men because he (my husband)refusal to agree with the so called president to take the lands/farms  of the whites who contribute to make the country what it is today. Because of my husbands sincerity he was constantly briefing the press  on what is going wrong in the country and the autocratic government of Mugabe.He was assassinated on 23 November 2001 being Sunday by 8.45 in Harare,  in Western  province of Zimbabwe, the planners of the assassination are well know by the masses.

I want to assure you also that this  transaction is 100% risk free as no other person knows this  apart from my first Son Samuel and I.

Also, there is a vicious rumour going round that a year or so ago a rather large company in the UK lost a court case where an employee sent out some kind of libellous email or somesuch despite the company having implemented email disclaimers. pay no heed to this - its just a rumour (http://www.weblaw.co.uk/artemail.htm).Anyway, please: Email exel.com!!!> kevinNB: This email is copyright 2002 Paul Jakma.

legitimate,phishing,True,"Cabot Wealth Advisiory 7/5/07 - TV, Intelligence and More July 5, 2007  Salem, Massachusetts  By Timothy Lutts  -----  There's Nothing On!  The SAT Measures What?  A Company With Predictive Decisioning Software  -----  My wife recently attended a conference in upstate New York and one night found herself back in her hotel room, turning to the television for entertainment.  Now, in our family, real-time network television is a rare event.    Thanks to Replay TV, a one-time competitor of TiVo in the DVR (digital video recorder) business, our favorite shows get recorded on a big hard disk and we watch them when we want, skipping the commercials as we go.  In fact, the only time we watch commercials is during the Super Bowl.  More often, we read.  In any event, there was my wife, in a New York state hotel room, ""forced"" to choose from a dreadful selection of real-time network TV offerings.  Of course she could have turned it off, but in that dull hotel room in that strange town, she was just searching for a little life, a little humor, a little intelligence.  What she got was bad TV, along with an onslaught of repetitive, often-insulting commercials.  So she called me, and somewhere along the way she asked, ""Why do people watch this garbage?  And why do the networks play the same commercials, sometimes several times during the same show?""  I couldn't give her an easy answer, but I did sympathize, and that's really what she wanted.  Soon after, I googled ""top ten TV shows,"" and here's what I found.  America's Got Talent Dateline NBC Deal or No Deal Law and Order N-C-I-S C-S-I Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader? Two and A Half Men So You Think You Can Dance? C-S-I Miami  I've never seen any of these, which goes to show you how out of touch I am.  But I do know (from reading) that four of them are crime dramas, two are talent searches, two are game shows, one is a sitcom and one is a news magazine that typically focuses on human-interest stories.  Reviewing this list, I'm reminded of the words of HL Mencken, who wrote, ""No one in this world, so far as I know, has ever lost money by underestimating the intelligence of the great masses of the plain people.""  Then, a few days ago one of my editors commented to me, no doubt after viewing one of the those headlines like ""Man Shoots Self in Groin While Attempting To Make Ham Sandwich,"" ""You know, half of Americans are of below average intelligence.""  Upon reflection, it's obvious.  And it's statistically inevitable.    The average is near the middle, so half will always be below the average (technically, below the median, but given the very large numbers we're dealing with, there's little difference.)  And if you don't know the difference between mean and median, you probably haven't crammed for an SAT test lately.  The converse, however, does not mean that if you do know the difference you have crammed for the test recently.  That's logic at work.  And the SAT, now that I've brought it up, is not what it used to be.  In 1901 it debuted as the Scholastic Achievement Test, supposedly measuring what students had learned.  In 1941, the name was changed to Scholastic Aptitude Test, supposedly measuring what students were capable of learning, if they had the proper socio-economic advantages.  In 1990, that was changed to Scholastic Assessment Test, supposedly measuring . . . something scholastic?  And in 1994 the name was changed to SAT (the letters officially standing for nothing at all!)  Finally (or, should I say, most recently, because I suspect there are more changes around the corner), in 2005 the name was changed to SAT Reasoning Test, creating a potential redundancy of the word ""Test"" but only if the first T still stood for Test, which it doesn't.  Reasoning, of course, includes logic, and I like that a lot. I hope they keep that name for a while.  Now, I took the SAT a few decades back.  Two of my kids have taken it and the third is likely to in a couple years.  But something else has changed over the decades besides the name.  In 1995 the yardstick for scoring was adjusted to account for the growing number of kids from less rigorous schools taking the test.  The reason?  The big bulge in the middle of the distribution curve, which had previously been centered at 400, had slipped down into the mid-300s.  To get the mid-point back up, the average verbal score was artificially increased by some 70 points while the average math score had 20-30 points added.  The kids at the top and bottom were barely affected, but the masses of average kids near the middle saw their scores bumped up dramatically.  What does it matter?  Well, a good score helps you get into college.    But is there a correlation between success on the SAT and success in college?  Looking further out, is there correlation between success on the SAT and success in life?  The simple answer is, some, but not a lot.  And more and more colleges are recognizing that; the number of colleges that admit students without regard to test scores now exceeds 400.  But the SAT lives on, and will continue to be here for years to come.  Why?  In part because it's the product of The College Board.    The College Board is a non-profit organization, and while there's no doubt that it works hard to serve the high schools and colleges and families that use it, there's even less doubt - in my mind - that the organization works even harder to ensure its own survival.   ----- ADVERTISEMENT -----  Join Cabot Stock of The Month and get in on the next stock that explodes like these...   * Broadvision-up 670%  * Intuitive Surgical-up 500%  * Yahoo-up 317%  * Amazon.com-up 1,290%  * First Marblehead-up 50%  * International Game Technology-up 110%  * eResearch Technology-up 180%  * NetEase-up 100%  * Expedia-up 114%  * Broadcom-up 97%  * Netflix-up 173%  * Psychiatric Solutions-up 85%  * PetroKazakhstan-up 86%  * Nautilus-up 109%  That's the beauty of Cabot Stock of the Month.

""A financial services firm in Japan has begun offering lower mortgage interest rates to ""intelligent"" customers.  GE Consumer Finance Company is giving discounts to people who have good English or computer skills, and work in ""high-value"" areas such as the law.  The company says more highly skilled workers usually find it easier than others to get jobs and to keep them. They are therefore less likely to become insolvent and default on their home loan.  GE Consumer Finance Company claims this is the first time that mortgage rates have been calculated like this in Japan.  People who have high scores on a test of English proficiency and officially certified IT skills can apply for a small discount.  Those of them who also have certain jobs - such as lawyers, accountants, doctors and financial experts - can obtain further discounts.  If a couple are both employed in the 20 ""high-value"" professions listed by the company, they will be entitled to a major rate reduction.""  It makes sense, and I'm guessing it's illegal to discriminate that way in the U.S.  -----  Getting back to TV, the problem is not just the quality of programming but the quantity of time people spend viewing.  The TV is on for over 7 hours in the average American home, and the average American watches over 4 hours of TV per day.  Worse still, the average American child watches 1,023 hours of TV a year and spends 900 hours in school.  And one thing they're seeing in those hours is commercials.  For broadcast TV, commercials pay the bills, and the advertisers are doing all they can to ensure that the message from those commercials reaches your brain.  But more and more these days, people are working to avoid those commercials by fast-forwarding through them using DVRs.  So NBC recently tested people to see if those commercials had any impact at high-speed.  NBC, you know, wants its advertisers' money even if viewers are watching at fast speeds.  The result, according to a story three days ago in The New York Times, ""judging from the biological reactions, the test subjects were just as engaged while watching fast-forwarded advertisements as they were while viewing opening scenes from the NBC show ""Heroes"" at regular speed.""  When it comes to fast-forward advertisements, ""the assumption has always been that they have no economic value, that they have no communication value,"" said Alan Wurtzel, president for research at NBC Universal. ""But the fact of the matter is we're learning that they are valuable.""  And they're so ""valuable"" to the financial health of the TV industry that the commercial-skipping DVR that I bought years ago can no longer be bought!  But the problem is not just the commercials.  The problem is that every minute spent watching TV is a minute not being used to reflect, to do something productive, or to interact with other family members.  And the result of all this TV viewing, according to a recent study by the Culture and Media Institute, is that ""increased exposure to television correlates with a decline in acceptance of personal responsibility.""  Now, it's important to note that the word correlate was used there.    Officially, there's no established causality.  But my sense is that our country has seen a marked decrease in a sense of personal responsibility; that too many people all too easily blame others for their troubles.  And when personal responsibility shrinks, we get a culture that thinks it's okay to act stupid because somebody else will pick up the tab.  ----- Contest -----  Now, there is an investment idea coming here, but first I want to give a reward to a loyal reader who has chosen to read this far.

Do it now.  -----  And now, finally, here we are at today's stock.  It's about intelligence and it's about marketing, and if you understand how important marketing is to the world, you may like this one enough to invest in it.  You know and I know that at every turn, companies are doing their darndest to sell us things.  At Amazon they know what I've bought before and thus know what to sell me next.  And at Netflix they know what movies I've rated highly so they can suggest other movies they think I'd enjoy.  Those two firms have developed specialized software that serves their individual needs, but for most companies, there's off-the-shelf software that works very well, and a lot of it is coming from a company named Chordiant.  Here's what we wrote in a recent issue of Cabot Top Ten Report.  ""Chordiant (CHRD) makes customer service and marketing software that helps big companies deal with their customers, so that the goals of both the merchant and the customer are met. Customers include 21st Century Insurance, Bank of Ireland, Banque Populaire, Barclays, Capital One, Covad Communications, Cox Communications, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Lloyds, MetLife, Nokia, Prudential, Royal Bank of Scotland, Royal Dutch Shell, Time Warner Cable, T-Mobile, UPS and Wachovia. These are huge blue-chip companies, yet Chordiant is still a small company, and growing fast. Historically, the company has had trouble making a profit (its last profitable year was 2004), but after the first quarter's terrific results, CEO Steven R. Springsteel commented that solid profitability was ""due to the strong performance in our international business, the acceleration of percentage of completion project implementations in Europe, and greater enablement of our partners resulting in fewer Chordiant resources being required on some project implementations."" It sounds good to us. Since then the company has been awarded a patent for ""advanced predictive decisioning technology."" In other words, the companies using this software sometimes know what you're going to buy before you do! As companies come to depend on this software, Chordiant's future is likely to be consistently profitable, and the realization of that is why the stock is strong today.""  Digging deeper, I see that Chordiant has been growing revenues since 2003, and in the latest quarter saw revenues grow 25% from the year before to $32.8 million, while earnings jumped from a penny per share to $0.18 per share.  Analysts are projecting a profit of $0.48 per share this year and $0.72 per share next year.  And the after-tax profit margin was a fat 19.6%.  Trading at 16, it's rather low-priced and thus carries the extra risk of volatility that comes from stocks at this level.   But average trading volume is nearly 500,000 shares per day, and institutional interest is growing.  I'd like it better on a dip to 15, but if it doesn't dip there in the week ahead, 16 may be the best price you'll get.  -----  Editor's note:  To get regular updates on Chordiant, and to get first notice of other hot stocks, consider a no-risk trial subscription to Cabot Top Ten Report.

But we don't really know exactly why Cho Seung-Hui went on a rampage on the campus of Virginia Tech. For our first story, correspondent Scott Pelley talks to Secret Service intelligence officers, whose exhaustive research into the minds of potential assassins and school shooters will provide valuable insights. Pelley is speaking with the officers today, April 20, and will report this story over the weekend, for what will perhaps be the freshest look yet at the mind of this mass killer.         This past week was also the deadliest in Baghdad - over 200 Iraqis were killed in a single day.  It has become a living hell for citizens of Baghdad just trying to get through an average day, as correspondent Lara Logan reports in our second story. How does one live in such a place? Very carefully, reports Logan, and often with the protection of a weapon, or in the case of Dr. Quoresh al-Kasir, the U.S. military. Nearly 200 doctors have been murdered in Iraq by insurgents intent on destroying Iraqi society. Soon after bullets began to crash through his windows, Dr. Quoresh heard a hopeful sound. ""We heard the helicopters starting to come to the area. My sons and daughter said, 'Oh, Baba, the Americans started to reach the area.'""     Watch  Logan's Reporter's Notebook.        The firing of Don Imus for uttering racially charged and misogynistic words black rap stars routinely use in their lyrics has shifted the spotlight to hip-hop culture and its dark messages.  As you'll see in our third piece, CNN's Anderson Cooper discovers that one of the rappers' popular messages, ""stop snitchin',"" does not help the police, but has actually confounded investigators' efforts to solve crimes, especially murder, and has now created some lawless neighborhoods.  Says Geoffrey Canada, educator and anti-violence advocate from New York City's Harlem neighborhood, ""It's like we're saying to the criminals, 'You can have our community....Do anything you want and we will either deal with it ourselves or we'll simply ignore it.'""

Dear Friend,  I am Mr.Brian Capon the system and control director at the NATIONAL WESTMINISTER BANK.I am writing this letter to solicit for support and assistance from you to carry out this business opportunity in my bank.  Lying in an inactive account is the sum of 11million pounds sterling belonging to a foreign customer(Michael Gambone) who was a gas consultant here in UK,who happens to be deceased during a business trip. He died with his wife(Deborah Gambone) on board the Swissair Flight 111 , which crashed into the Atlantic off Nova Scotia in september 2nd 1998. The news of this crash was on the news which we have notified his relatives to no avail.See links below for more detail information:  http://cnnstudentnews.cnn.com/WORLD/9809/swissair.victims.list/ http://cnnstudentnews.cnn.com/WORLD/americas/9809/08/swissair.02/  Ever since he died the bank has been expecting his next of kin to come and claim these fund. To this effect, we can not release the money unless someone applies for it as next of kin, as indicated in our banking guideline.Unfortunately he has no family member in UK or Over-sea who are aware of the existence of the money(as he was a gas consultant. At this juncture i have decided to do business with you by soliciting your assistance in applying as the next of kin to the bank then the money will be released to you,as I do not want this money to go into the bank treasury as an unclaimed bill,because the banking law and guideline stipulates that if such money(s) remains unclaimed  for a period of up to nine years(9yrs),the money will be transferred into the bank treasury as an unclaimed bill. My request for a foreigner as next of kin is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a British cannot stand as next of kin.  50% of the money will be your share as a foreign partner and your assistance to actualise this business,thereafter i will visit your country with your help once the money hits your account for disbursement according to the percentage indicated. To effect the immediate transfer of the fund to you as agreed,you must apply first to the bank as the next of kin to the deceased,then we will follow up all formalities for the transaction.  Upon receipt of your reply, i will send to you, the text of the application you are to send to the bank,and further clearify you in other issues as to effect this business. Awaiting to hear from you urgently.  Best Regards Mr.Brian Capon.",1

legitimate,phishing,True,"RE: Redfield Deliverability Project I would appear to me that there may be some misconceptions here.     Why do we assume that by entering into a financing deal we will be any better off?  I would tell you that to the extent there was any risk in the deal, that we should probably charge someone else about 25-30% as well.     Think about it, 25% is only 15% after tax.   Has some one enumerated the risks and valued them on this deal?   I haven't seen any of that work, if it has been done.           I think I understand the concept proposed and I understand the proposed goal line, return with little or no expense up front.     I would assume that we would be willing to enter into a fixed price service agreement for a number of years?     Is Halliburton willing to take any risks whatsoever?  Alternatively, why don't we go through GSS (Global Strategic Sourcing) to look for a better deal?	  Jim:   Have you looked at this for ideas on the accounting side?    Why can't I do a prepayment of a service contract fee and recognize the expense over the life of the deal?   -----Original Message----- From: 	Waymire, Dave   Sent:	Wednesday, October 17, 2001 9:17 AM To:	Hayslett, Rod; Gilbert, Steve Cc:	Centilli, James Subject:	RE: Redfield Deliverability Project  Rod,  Below is some background on the Redfield Deliverability Project.  Halliburton initiated the contact with NNG to provide work over on selected wells based on software modeling in order to return deliverability to their original levels.  The work overs are planned over a 2-3 year period and are expected to have a lasting effect of at least 10 years.  The cost to model and rework these wells is estimated to be $5.73MM.  A test program would be conducted in the first year to determine the feasibility of continuing the program at a cost of $768,000.  If the test program did not prove out the project would be terminated at this point.  The original proposal was to treat the costs of the program as expense as the costs were incurred. Bob Chandler confirmed this accounting treatment.  This would result as Kent has indicated negative EBIT for the first 2-3 years.   As an alternative it was proposed to Halliburton that NNG would enter into a 10 year service agreement with Halliburton to model and rework the wells and provide guidance on proposed well work overs for the Redfield storage field.  Halliburton would agree to perform the test program and if test results indicate that further work overs would be economically feasible would spend an additional $4.96MM on a total of 60 well workovers in the first 3 years of the contract.  NNG currently budgets $300,000 per year for Redfield well maintenance with minimal increase in deliverability. Operations has committed $300,000 per year in well maintenance over the next 5 years to this project for a total of $1.5MM.  Halliburton has not formalized their counter offer, but has indicated that they would require a 25% to 30% return for assuming the financing.  Halliburton indicated that this is a non-standard deal for them and that is the reason for high return requirement.    The objective is to structure the deal as a service agreement either with an Enron Entity who would then contract with Halliburton or some other third party at a more reasonable rate.  Even at an estimated 30% return, preliminary incremental EBIT estimates for the Halliburton service agreement are between $400,000 to $500,000 the first 5 years and  $250,00 to $275,000 for the out years.       -----Original Message----- From: 	Hayslett, Rod   Sent:	Friday, October 12, 2001 7:05 AM To:	Gilbert, Steve Cc:	Waymire, Dave Subject:	RE: Redfield Deliverability Project  Couple of quick comments.    Prepaying as an expense would require coming up with some income to offset, and generally doesn't make economic sense.   An Enron company can't help because it consolidates, and therefore ends up with the same accounting results as we do.       What accountants have reviewed the proposal?   -----Original Message----- From: 	Miller, Kent   Sent:	Thursday, October 11, 2001 9:52 AM To:	Hayslett, Rod; McCarty, Danny Cc:	Waymire, Dave; Neubauer, Dave; Neville, Sue; Thomas, Steve Subject:	Redfield Deliverability Project  Rod,  We looking for your help on some ideas on how to implement a good long term project that has negative short term cash flow.  We have been working with Halliburton to identify deliverability improvements at Redfield through the use of  improved technology related to identifying poor performing wells and implementing down hole remediation.  This project has costs and revenues as shown below that are great from a long term standpoint.  Steve Thomas and Maurice Gilbert have done an excellent job of identifying the benefits to NNG and the upsides in revenue that are expected.  Dave Waymire has also been very helpful in analyzing alternative and economics and have shown that the project has a great return (in excess of 30%).  Our problem is that the cost for the workovers at Redfield are all O&M expenses and not capital and we have a negative IBIT for the first 2 - 3 years of the project.  We have proposed that Halliburton structure the expenses such that they come in over a 5 - 10 year period so we don't have this negative IBIT flow in the first years, however, Halliburton has not been interested and has proposed a 30% finance charge for this structure.  What would be the appetite for possibly pre-paying a majority of these costs in '01 to avoid the negative '02 and '03 earnings impact or is there an Enron company that would finance/extend the expense payments.  This is a great project that we should do, however, it is difficult given the negative earnings impacts in the first couple of years.  Got any ideas to handle this financial hurdle??????

Box 57052 Washington, DC 20037-7052  May 9, 2007  Members of Congress United States of America  Dear Member of Congress:  I wish to bring to your immediate attention the recent attacks on American intellectual property being perpetrated by Brazil and Thailand. These attacks endanger the basis of American prosperity, innovation, and jobs. Unless vigorous measures are taken soon, such attacks are likely to spread to other countries, to the further detriment of U.S. national interests.  Last Friday, Brazils President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva issued a ""compulsory license"" to override the U.S. patent on an AIDS drug made by Merck. Obviously, this measure undercuts future research and development on medical innovation, upon which the health of millions around the world depend.  The public rationale given by the governments of Thailand and Brazil to override the property rights of foreign firms is invalid. Issuing a compulsory license in this manner is considered by USA for Innovation to be illegitimate under World Trade Organization rules, indisputably bad policy, and dangerous precedent.  When Brazil and Thailand issue compulsory licenses, they signal to the world their unwillingness to respect international patent protection. If this grows into more of a trend  which it will, unless strongly resisted -- innovators will no longer choose to provide life-saving drugs and other medicines in these countries.  Moreover, such a move is short-sighted for the countries themselves. It hurts local firms in Brazil and Thailand trying to attract foreign investment. It hurts their patients, who will no longer have access to patented medicines which, in many cases, are the only treatments proven safe and effective.  Thailand and Brazil have no excuse for their behavior. They are not poor countries, and cannot claim to be in crisis. Thailands GDP ranks it among the top 10% wealthiest countries in the world, and its government spends little on health care. The World Health Organization notes that Thailand spends far less on health care (3.3% of GDP) than peers such as Argentina (8.9%) or poorer countries like Cambodia (10.9%) or Lebanon (10.2%). The United States spends 15.2%.  What is true in Thailand is even truer of Brazil. It is not only in the top 10% of richest countries in the world, but in the top 5%. While Brazil spends a greater percentage of its GDP on health (7.6%) than Thailand, it is still half of what America spends.  In attacking intellectual property rights of American and European companies, Brazil and Thailand threaten innovation, which is the lifeblood of our economy. In this age of globalization, U.S. intellectual property is our comparative advantage.  A 2005 study by two leading economists  the Democratic, Clinton-appointee Dr. Robert Shapiro and Republican advisor Dr. Kevin Hassett -- estimates that U.S. intellectual property is worth between $5 trillion and $5.5 trillion. This equals approximately 45% of the U.S. GDP, and is greater than the GDP of any other nation in the world.  Intellectual property accounts for about one-quarter of all business investment over the last decade. Intangibles now account for nearly two-thirds of the market value of large U.S. public companies.  As importantly, nearly 3 million American jobs depend on continued investment in biopharmaceuticals. The world benefits from the life-saving results produced by these American scientists, researchers, doctors and teachers. More than 70% of all world medicines are created by Americans. International refusal to pay for these products not only threatens millions of American jobs, it endangers our ability to produce the new medical treatments the ailing around the world need most desperately.  Both Brazil and Thailand enjoy extraordinary benefits from Americans. While American workers face expensive tariffs when exporting goods and services to these countries (including, incredibly, taxes and tariffs on medical products), both Brazil and Thailand receive generous treatment when sending their products to the U.S. under the Generalized System of Preferences.  Both countries also receive a host of military, humanitarian and other forms of assistance from the U.S. government, in addition to private donations from millions of American charities. It seems appropriate to remind leaders of these countries that the United States will protect innovation-producing American firms and jobs. Doing so now, in a vigorous manner, will save lives in these countries and throughout the world.  Sincerely yours,  Kenneth L.

This is not so much ""clear"" as ""completely different"", but yes, that is the principle meaning of the word ""materials"" and the ony logical reason why the author would've used the term here.  A court is going to consider what the apparent intent was -- not try to stretch the meaning beyond the obvious.  > Would you expect an art *materials* catalogue to...  Hereafter, you are trying to stretch the meaning to something that it obviously wasn't intended to mean.  You can do that, because the license is POORLY WRITTEN. Which I have already said. Miraculously, you and I appear to AGREE on that point.  One consequence of this is that some lawyer might try to play the same games with the language that you are doing here.  I think the court would laugh in his face, but who knows?  > I'm trying to understand how it is possible to claim that compilers > don't fit the meaning of materials there  That would be by using the *normal*, *first* definition of ""materials"" and not some alternate meaning that has come about by association.  There is also the point that it wouldn't make any sense to require the meaning you are attempting to press: is there even a compiler which can be ""released in source format under conditions of this license""? If not, then it stands to reason that the author, knowing this, cannot have intended to limit compilation to such a hypothetical compiler. This is yet more evidence for an intent which agrees with the obvious interpretation of the language.  So, are you saying you honestly believe the author's intent was to block compilation of changes to his package altogether? If so, why distribute source at all? Furthermore, you believe that having this irrational intent, he then tried to hide it by using a word which *might* be interpreted to support his intent, but whose most obvious meaning contradicts it?  I find that a pretty implausible theory.  Your interpretation is distorts the license's original intent by using alternate meanings of words. As such it may even be semantically correct (that is, it may be within the set of possible semantic meanings of the utterance), but it is pragmatically incorrect (it is not the subset of that set that was meant by the author -- as we can tell from context). Intent is a matter of pragmatics[1] -- the study of situated utterances as evidence for meaning, not semantics[2] -- the study of isolated utterances for potential meaning.  You're pounding very hard on the semantics, trying to broaden the set of possible meanings, and you're not wrong about that as far as you go, but that's missing the point. The question was not ""what could this sentence possibly mean"", but ""what did this sentence mean when the author wrote it"" -- which is what actually matters legally.  The rest of the license, the fact of using the license, the fact of releasing software with source code and the consequences of licensing choices all provide situational information which supports the pragmatic interpretation of the sentence in question.  The fact that courts (or we) have to go beyond semantics to understand the license is a serious flaw of the license, which I've already pointed out, but as evidence of the author's actual intent, I think it is sufficient.

Michael's Minute:  Lindows.com Report Card  As summer arrives, many school children are coming home with their report cards.  I thought this would be a good time to see what kind of grades Lindows.com received for their first 9 months in operation..   To view the Timeline of Lindows.com's first 9 months in business, click here  .  Operating System:   As of last week, consumers can experience LindowsOS in one of two ways. One way is to buy a computer running LindowsOS from Walmart.com  , for as little as $299. This is a significant milestone for us, as we've partnered with our first builder (Microtel) and retailer (Walmart). These computers work great out of the box and are ideal for general purpose computing tasks.  For those who already have a computer and also wish to try LindowsOS, we offer the Insider program  . This gives people wanting early access to LindowsOS a chance to try out LindowsOS as it develops. Currently, Insiders report installation success about 80%  of the time on their PCs. Therefore we have some room to grow, consequently, this product is not yet for everyone.  Some may wonder how we can sell a computer at Walmart  when the program available directly from Lindows.com is billed as not completely ready. The difference is the Walmart   computers are certified, ensuring that all components  work elegantly with LindowsOS. That's much different than offering a software program that will work on any computer in the world - that's very difficult. It's the difference between making a single pair of shoes for a known foot size versus opening a shoe store with every style of shoe for every size foot. The first one is easy, the second one is a much bigger job. While the installer is fantastically easy and fast (the entire OS installs in under 5 minutes), we've got a lot more work to do to support a wider range of hardware, printers and other devices. Grade:  B   _____   Software:  Our goal to give people choice means giving them choice not just on their operating system, but access to all the programs they'll want to add to their computer to really make it work for them in their school, home or business. Click-N-Run   is the easiest way to load software onto a computer. For the first time a Linux based system has leapt ahead of Microsoft's operating systems in ease of use. With 1,000 plus programs already in the Click-N-Run Warehouse  , users can find quality software titles for just about any computing task and, with a single mouse-click download, install and run these programs. All these titles are included in the $99. This is a fantastic consumer experience and price point. Look for a lot more great software in the Warehouse in the future. Grade: A-   _____   Microsoft Windows Compatibility: We live in a Microsoft world, so there needs to be a bridge from the legacy world to the broadband LindowsOS world. This means we need to support some bridge programs, file types and network devices to help people interact with the legacy Microsoft world. LindowsOS computers come with software to view, print and copy popular Microsoft applications like: MS Word files, MS PowerPoint files and MS Excel documents. There's great Linux based alternatives and we'll guide people to those alternatives (they're better than most people realize). To edit Microsoft files, we'd highly recommend one of the office suites in our Warehouse such as OpenOffice  .  Many of these programs are of very high-quality and a great value since they're included in the Warehouse  . Sometimes there are no viable alternatives for those programs, so we're investing necessary resources to support some Microsoft Windows based programs. Stay tuned for more developments in this area. Our printer support is ok, but there's lots of room for more drivers. Connecting to MS Windows based file servers is still a challenge. We need to get better in the above areas.  Grade: B    _____   Communication: We've tried to be diligent in communicating where our company is going which is why there's typically a weekly Michael's Minute  . While our overall goal has not deviated - Bringing Choice To Your Computer - our implementation has become more focused as we listened to what our Insiders and potential customers have told us. (Keep sending me your comments.) We have been de-emphasizing running Microsoft Windows programs because many of you told us you detest spending hundreds of dollars on individual software programs, forced upgrades and activation codes. It's not just the operating system, but costly Microsoft programs you're wanting to avoid.  Consequently, we've been emphasizing Click-N-Run because it will change the way you think about software. Having a neatly categorized library   of 1,000+ software titles all for a flat annual fee at your digital fingertips is an entirely new way to think about paying for software. It's immediate, elegant and affordable. There are lots of mischaracterizations about Lindows.com swirling around - which happens when you have a small organization which can't address every question or publication. We'll do a better job of addressing these in the future. For now, I wrote up answers to the Top Myths about Lindows.com. Check them out by visiting: www.lindows.com/myths  Grade: B+   _____   Overall: B+ Michael Robertson Please visit support.lindows.com   to answer questions you may have about LindowsOS or Lindows.com. Bringing Choice to Your Computer!    LindowsOS is presently available on LindowsOS Certified Computers being offered from Lindows.com   Builder partners.  The General Release of LindowsOS (available now for download and preview to Lindows.com   Insider partners) will be made available later this year for those wishing to install and run LindowsOS on their existing computer hardware.  The General Release version will support a wider range of computer hardware and includes unique features such as a ""Friendly-Install"" alongside an existing MicrosoftR Windows operating system, a streamlined installation process which requires no computer knowledge, and the ability to run a select set of ""bridge"" Windows-compatible programs.

However, weak market fundamentals, including a sluggish economy and increased  US and Canadian supplies, will mitigate the usual winter price rise. CERA  expects an average Henry Hub price of $2.35 in November.  *  Although inventories are close to record levels, storage pressures are  increasingly unlikely to drive cash markets down significantly this year.   *  Gas demand will average 14 percent lower than a year earlier; residential  and commercial sectors show a decline with a return to normal weather, while a  weak economy offsets the return of ammonia and dual-fuel loads in the  industrial sector.  *  Regional storage inventories and weak regional demand should keep upward  pressure off of regional differentials.

AUSTRALIA ADDS TO MIGRATION OCCUPATIONS IN DEMAND LIST  09 May 2005 ________________________________________________________________________________________________________   On 8 May Australian Government announced changes to its immigration strategy by adding to its Migration Occupations in Demand List (MODL). The changes affect skilled visas for immigration to Australia.  The MODL and Skills Occupation List (SOL) form part of the backbone of Australia's point-based skilled migration strategy. Applicants under the points tested General Skilled Migration program for Australia who nominate an occupation on the MODL are awarded 15 points.   The following occupations were added to the MODL on 4 May 2005:  PROFESSIONAL: Civil Engineer  Dentist  Nuclear Medicine Technologist  Podiatrist  Speech Pathologist  TRADES: Bricklayer  Cabinetmaker  Carpenter & Joiner  Cook  Electrical Powerline Tradesperson  Electrician (Special Class)  Electronic Equipment Tradesperson  Fibrous Plasterer  General Electrician  General Electronic Instruments Tradesperson  General Plumber  Solid Plaster  OTHER OCCUPATIONS WHICH ARE IN THE EXISTING MODL ARE: Accountants  Chef  Hairdresser  Medical Practitioner  Physiotherapist  Registered Nurse    Immigration to Australia is especially for skilled people who wish to emigrate to a Country with a great lifestyle and excellent job opportunities. Unemployment is at an all-time low of 5.1%, the lowest in the last 25 years.  You do not need to relocate immediately after your application for permanent residence is approved. Normally, you can wait for 3 years from date of approval to relocate. Furthermore, the application and approval process can take a long time, usually more than a year.

New plant  plus significantly reduced summer demand through conservation has put the  West's capacity margin at 15 percent, but regional balances vary widely. Power  demand declines have also completely relieved the West Coast gas supply  shortfall. Despite low hydroelectric output, gas demand for power generation in  the West is actually down from last year.  *  Energy conservation in response to the retail price increase, cool weather,  and the slowing economy is the strongest fundamental driver in California.   *  New power supplies have arrived, but grid operators cannot count on full  nameplate capacity within the first few months of a new plant's start date.  *  Pacific Northwest hydroelectric resources remain critically low despite low  demand, raising the specter of reliability problems this winter.  **end**  Follow above URL for complete Monthly Briefing (9 printed pages).

legitimate,phishing,True,"You Did a Good Job Dear Mr. Lay:  In this trying time of second-guesses and angry shareholders, I wanted to let you know that I have appreciated working for you and share a quick story of how you shaped my view of Enron and the corporate world in general.  My second rotation as an associate was to write speeches for the Office of the Chairman.  Generally, I was creating presentations for Jeff Skilling, but I did create a couple for you as well.  The one I remember best was for the speech at Astro Hall for the Houston Energy Conference where we announced Enron Online.  Not only did you let me lead the internal roundtable (I remember sitting at the table, trying to keep my composure as Greg Whalley, Dan Leff, Louise Kitchen and others asked specifics about the slides I created), but you also (generally) agreed with my answers and thanked me for a job well done.  That night, I shared a bottle of champagne with my wife and truly believed I could do anything!!  So, as far as I am concerned, you have done a tremendous job.  Everything happening now is unfortunate.  It happened on your watch and thus is partly your responsibility.  But you have stepped up to the plate, most likely saved more jobs than lost, and been accountable in more ways than one.

legitimate,phishing,True,"[Ip-health] WSJ: trade deal a small step for generics -- [ Picked text/plain from multipart/alternative ] In Trade Deal, a Shift on Generics  *Agreement Opens the Door To Cheaper Drugs Abroad,  Easing Some Patent Rules *  *By SARAH LUECK*  *Wall Street Journal, **May 17, 2007; Page A4*  WASHINGTON -- A new trade agreement between Congress and the White House contains provisions that open the door to more sales of generic drugs in developing countries. The plan, reversing earlier gains for American drug makers backed by President Bush, marks the first big setback for the pharmaceutical industry since Democrats claimed Capitol Hill.  For now, the provisions likely only affect pending trade deals with Peru, Panama and Colombia. But the plan also signals a broader shift as congressional leaders give greater weight in trade talks to providing cheaper medicines for the poor, even if it means denying the Republican-friendly drug industry some of the protection it says it needs.  The administration ""has permitted the weakening of intellectual-property protections in these agreements,"" said Billy Tauzin, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the drug industry's main trade group, in an interview. ""They were desperate to get continuing trade authority"" from Democrats in Congress, he said. ""The fact is, their leverage changed since November.""  The main focus of the bipartisan trade deal, announced last week, involves requiring U.S. trade partners to meet new standards for giving their workers labor rights and ensuring environmental protections. But the deal also allows developing countries more flexibility in dealing with U.S. drug makers than they would have had under earlier versions.  Specifically, the policy would ease requirements on developing-country regulators to prevent the sale of patent-infringing products. It also releases trading partners from a requirement to extend the time for patent protections as a form of compensation for delays in drug approvals.  Public-health advocacy groups have argued for years that U.S. trade policy under Mr. Bush often protected brand-name drug makers at the expense of poor countries in need of more-affordable treatments. Many of those groups said they weren't satisfied with last week's deal. Even with the changes, they say, the Peru and Panama deals advance many of the protections the drug industry wants -- just fewer than would have existed if the Bush administration had stuck with its earlier trade stance.  *""Compared to the many steps backward that have been taken since 2003, this is a bit of relief for people who want access to affordable medicines,"" said Ellen Shaffer, co-director of the Center for Policy Analysis on Trade and Health in San Francisco. ""Compared to an actual policy that would provide affordable medicines for people and fairly balance that with innovation, it is a small step forward.""*  Trade is just one of many fronts where the pharmaceutical industry faces a less friendly policy environment, after enjoying strong support during years of undivided Republican rule. Some Democrats want to rewrite the Medicare prescription-drug benefit to allow the government to negotiate lower prices with manufacturers. Some Democrats also want to legalize imports of cheaper medications from Canada and other countries. The Bush administration has maintained its support for the industry on those issues, and the Senate has blocked those policy changes.  But on exports, the administration last week changed course. For the last several years, U.S. trade officials and drug companies have worked to push new protections for drug makers in countries such as signers of the Central American Free Trade Agreement.  Companies say stronger safeguards for their patents and proprietary data are needed in many countries, to delay generic competition and make it worthwhile for the industry to continue to invest in research and development of new treatments.  Under the new American trade strategy, the biggest loss for the industry is a change that may shift more responsibility to drug makers for preventing the marketing of patent-infringing products.  Under recent trade agreements, the U.S. pressed countries to agree to ""linkage,"" which requires local drug regulators to make sure a generic product doesn't violate any patents before allowing it on the market. Public-health advocacy groups have said this puts makers of brand-name drugs at an advantage and burdens regulators. Drug companies support linkage because it prevents copies of their products from being sold during lengthy court battles. Without it, companies will have to be more vigilant. To take industry concerns into account, the new policy calls for countries to set up fast procedures for resolving patent disputes.  Another change in the new trade policy would weaken a common provision in past trade agreements: that local regulators ""shall"" compensate drug makers for delays in the process of approving their products, by awarding extra time to sell their products free from competition.  Some Democrats said this unfairly penalizes consumers in those countries for slow bureaucracies. A description of the changes to the Peru and Panama agreements says countries ""may"" extend a company's patent to make up for delays, suggesting more flexibility on what they are required to do to compensate drug makers.  Health-advocacy groups complain the new policy still preserves the data-exclusivity provision used to block generic competition. In many countries, including the U.S., makers of generic drugs can often win approval by proving their products are equivalent to the original drugs. In that process, regulators use test data submitted by makers of brand-name drugs. The data-exclusivity provision typically prevents such use of the data for five years, acting as an effective hurdle for generics. The new policy does, however, place more restrictions on the five-year data exclusivity than previously existed in the Panama and Peru agreements.  *Write to *Sarah Lueck at sarah.lueck@wsj.com1    *URL for this article: http://online.wsj.com/article/SB117936226237705632.html*    *Hyperlinks in this Article: (1) mailto:sarah.lueck@wsj.com  *   -- Ellen R.

Vinoble is the next HOT PLAY in Homeland Security  Symbol: VNBL.OB Current Price:      	    		$0.08 Short Term Target Price:    		$0.50    12 month Target Price:      		$4.OO   Deserves your immediate attention!!!  The company just bottomed at $O.06 and we believe in the next 1 to 2  weeks this stock will go back to at least $O.4O                    C O M P A N Y   O V E R V I E W   Vinoble, Inc. (VNBL.OB) is a holding company, which is identifying and  acquiring operational business opportunities in the areas of homeland  security, security information systems, and other security services to  provide long term growth for its shareholders.  Vinoble believes that the opportunity to build a successful business in  the security sector is unprecedented.  The terror attacks on the United States on September 11, 20O1 have  changed the security landscape for the foreseeable future. Both  physical  and logical security have become paramount for all industry segments,  especially in the banking, healthcare and government sectors. While the  focus for Vinoble is on North America, the opportunity for security  services is worldwide. According to Giga, a wholly owned subsidiary of  Forrester Research, worldwide demand for information security products  and  services is set to eclipse $46B by 2O05.  Vinoble intends to capitalize on the dramatic growth in the security  market by delivering professional services, security products, security  training, and managed security services. In pursuit of this objective,  Vinoble has assembled a highly qualified team of security professionals  offering a full range of security services. Through Vinoble's  consulting services and integrated delivery solutions, Vinoble will  help  organizations protect key assets including persons, property,  information,  brand, and reputation.   Homeland Security, the National Strategy for a Secure Cyberspace, the  Healthcare Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA),  Sarbanes-Oxley and other regulatory programs will all cause a continued  increase in security demands in the United States and abroad. Vinoble  intends  to position itself as the 'most desired' provider of, both, physical  and information security solutions - in the eyes of our clients,  alliance  partners, and peers. We will accomplish this by ensuring our teams are  the most knowledgeable, agile, professional, and cost-conscious  provider of 'tailored' security solutions to meet the unique needs of  each  client.  Management has partnered with GarcyCo Capital Corp. (""GCCC"") to assist  in finding acquisition candidates for the company, structuring such  acquisitions, and effecting a transition to corporate growth. At  present,  Vinoble and GCCC have targeted several companies as potential  acquisition candidates. Pending the outcome of due diligence and  audits, the  company believes the acquisition of these assets will provide the basis  required for listing on a national exchange.    HERE IS RECENT NEWS ON THE COMPANY:  MALIBU, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 2O, 2O05--Vinoble, Inc. (OTCBB:  VNBL - News), a holding company seeking to identify long-term growth  opportunities in the areas of homeland security, security information  systems, and other security services, is pleased to announce that as it  continues in its efforts to reach definitive agreements on the acquisition  of assets, businesses, and strategic partners in the RFID and GPS  tracking sector, Vinoble has further engaged with several additional  businesses and individuals for the purpose of acquiring technology, software,  and patents.   Following the move to acquire RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)  technology, hardware and patents for the sole purpose of specific use  applications, the Company has concluded that the need for application  support software or middleware is part of the fundamental component of the  framework which operates such technology. The Company has identified  several sources for both licensing and the acquisition of such software,  and has begun to pursue discussions to access this important element.   Middleware is used primarily to link disparate applications, both  internally and externally, to the enterprise. This typically involves  routing data using different transport protocols, translating data into  different formats and providing a suitable means of integration such as Web  services and service-oriented architectures.   Since RFID is an integral part in the tracking of both mobile and  non-mobile assets, user-friendly and efficient management software enabling  customers to manage RFID data both incoming and out-bound is important  in maintaining customer loyalty and reduces costs associated with  customer service. Management software will allow for real time visibility of  assets or product inventory, whether in transit, in a warehouse, at the  manufacturing plant, or on a store shelf. Visibility and accuracy will  enable customers to reduce handling costs, gain instant access to  shipment information and increase inventory flow throughout the supply  chain. The ability to manage data collection from a number of different RFID  and GPS devices is essential for proper efficiency of the system.   The Company believes that such acquisition of middleware technology  will be essential and will further position Vinoble in the vastly growing  RFID and GPS tracking industry. The Company's goal is to provide  critical security services at a cost manageable to even the smallest of  businesses that can't afford to do without the safety of their personnel and  assets in this current state of constant threat.

This kernel update also fixes a difficult to trigger race in the dcache (filesystem cache) code, as well as some potential security holes, although we are not currently aware of any exploits. Description: The 2.4.18-5 kernel introduced some safety checks in the VM subsystem that were triggered when exiting an X session while using 3D acceleration with the Intel i810/i815 chipset. Additionally, there was a difficult to trigger race in the dcache of the file system subsystem. This kernel update addresses both of these issues. In addition, there are fixes for potential security holes in the following drivers: stradis rio500 se401 usbvideo apm Finally, this kernel fixes a few files in the /proc file system which had the capability to expose kernel memory when abused. All of the security issues found during an audit and none of them,  at the time of this writing, have any known exploits. We would like to thank Silvio Cesare, Stas Sergeev, Andi Kleen, Solar Designer, and others for their auditing work.

""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stret! ch! . Trent Dilfer , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point. Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 10/23/01 Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck fr! om! a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week. Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 10/23/01 The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams. Dedric Ward , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season. Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Neal/McKay Updated 10/23/01 Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week. Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week. Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Tori U! pd! ated 10/23/01 Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use him this week. Terrence Wilkins , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week. Terrell Davis , RB DEN - JWillie Updated 10/23/01 Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they will activate h! im! . He will work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Martin Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice until late in the week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota.  Duce Staley , RB PHI - Giggles Updated 10/23/01 Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on 11 carries l! at! e in the game. At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a solid replacement.  Joe Nedney , K TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week.  Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Kinney will be listed on the injury report because of a calf injury. However, he is expected to play in this week's game.  Kevin Dyson , WR TEN - Bass/Hull Updated 10/23/01 Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice. Eddie George , RB TEN - Tori Updated 10/23/01 George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in this week's game.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Martin Updated 10/23/01 McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game.  Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence.  Damon Jones , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery.  Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Martin Updated 10/23/01 Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's game remains uncertain. ""All I know is that, from week to week, they increase his exercises and change of direction,"" head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. ""It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week."" Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23.  Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to action next week.  Todd Heap , TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle.  Terry Allen , RB BAL - Tori Updated 10/23/01 Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at running back if Allen is inactive.  Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Tori Updated 10/23/01 Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. ""I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest area,"" Grbac said Monday. ""There could be something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see."" Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unable to play.  Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Neal/McKay Updated 10/23/01 Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orleans.  Trung Canidate , RB STL - Giggles Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. ""I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game,"" coach Mike Martz said. ""He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play."" Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week.  J.J. Stokes , WR SF - Matty Updated 10/23/01 Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close to being completely healthy. ""Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was a blessing for me because I was ab! le! to get treatment every day,"" Stokes told the Contra Costa Times . ""I practiced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close."" Stokes has been less than mediocre, however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to be more reliable.  Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - Russell Updated 10/23/01 Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants' starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed.  Ron Dixon , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day.  Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Matty Updated 10/23/01 According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. ""I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago,"" Martz said. ""I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play."" Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to go.

legitimate,phishing,True,"RE: Transok Offsystem Fuel Accounting Procedure 	I have reviewed to orders issued by FERC.  They state ""Pipelines acquiring upstream capacity without prior Commission approval will be ""at-risk"" for the cost of that capacity"".  This means that Northern will need to track both the costs and revenues associated with offsystem transactions.  We believe that in tracking the revenues we can track by contract.    	Therefore, I believe in the meeting that if we needed to track these transactions Sue's group would maintain a manual spreadsheet for all off-system transactions.  	We also said Dan Fancler would need to review and determine how we would track the revenues thru the accounting side.    	I believe we have provided the answers we committed to in the meeting yesterday for today.  I plan to meet with Lynn B. tomorrow to discuss nominations, contract approval processes and other stuff.....  I'll let you know where we are as things develop.  thanks MW   -----Original Message----- From: 	Fancler, Dan   Sent:	Thursday, October 11, 2001 2:38 PM To:	Winckowski, Michele; Kirk, Steve; Miller, Kent; Neville, Sue; Williams, Jo; Blair, Lynn Cc:	Cobb Jr., John; Chandler, Bob; Kissner, Tim; Brennan, Patrick Subject:	Transok Offsystem Fuel Accounting Procedure  Based on our meeting 10/9/2001, I would like to propose the following accounting procedures for expensing in-kind fuel.  Case A:  In October 500,000 dts moves offsystem with only 486,000 dts expected to be returned to NNG in January.  NNG moves 500,000 dts from physical inventory to Offsystem inventory. No accounting entry made to the G/L.  Gas Accounting would reduce Offsystem inventory 14,000 dts to reflect in-kind fuel reduction in the same month the next NNG gas purchase transaction occurs (FIFO inventory method).  Reducing the Offsystem storage will cause UAF to increase, however purchasing gas for Operational Storage and not recording it to Operational Storage will offset the UAF increase.  If the next gas purchase transaction occurs in December at $3.00 then we would reduce Offsystem Storage Inventory by 14,000 dts in December production.  December UAF would not be affected.  Recorded in December: Debit 858 3rd Party Transport exp		14,000 * $3.00 = $42,000 	Credit A/P							($42,000)  Procedural Note:  All Third Party Offsystem storage statements must be forwarded to Gas Accounting (Dan Fancler) in order to reconcile the Physical to the Books.  Reconciling items such as in-kind fuel reductions will be reported to Storage Marketing noting that purchases for in-kind fuel replacements are needed.  If NNG purchases 100,000 dt for Operational Storage in December, then 14,000 dts would be carved out as in-kind fuel replacement and recorded to 858 (3rd party transport), the remaining 86,000 dts would be recorded as Operational Storage purchase and encroachment.  We may wish for the vender to issue two invoices.   Case B	 In October 500,000 dts moves offsystem, NNG purchases the in-kind replacement on Transok's system and 500,000  dts is expected to be returned to NNG in January.  NNG moves 500,000 dts from physical inventory to Offsystem inventory. No accounting entry made to the G/L. NNG does not reduce the offsystem physical inventory.  Recorded in month of purchase on Transok's system: Debit 858 3rd Party Transport exp		14,000 * $3.00 = $42,000 	Credit A/P							($42,000)  In both cases all transactions are recorded outside of operational storage, but gives Marketing some flexibility on when the in-kind replacement takes place but still follows a logical methodology (FIFO replacement).",0
