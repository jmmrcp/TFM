phishing,legitimate,True,legitimate,"*EMCA* An additional Restaurant Review..... Cole's on Waugh To add to the next Newsletter:  Julie,  My partner and I have not been very visable at any of the local meetings,   however we ALWAYS anxiously await the next installment of the newsletter.  We  have been extremely busy making the house we bought  on Bomar liveable,  it  was barely that way when we bought it.  We wanted to add to your restaurant review.  Cole's on Waugh is a fairly decent restaurant with an OK menu.   The Garlic  soup was a definite hit,  and the atmosphere was great.  The wine list is  good and the prices were very reasonable. The entrees need a bit of work,  the beef was very ""Gamey"", the chicken  dishes were dry,  and the fried shrimp were a bit greasy.     All things aside we have eaten there three times,  and deem it worth while.   We have seen the menu and service improve with each visit.  Our hope is that  if enough people visit Cole's the menu will improve.  It is in a very  convenient location and the owners and staff are very friendly.

Also, there is a vicious rumour going round that a year or so ago a rather large company in the UK lost a court case where an employee sent out some kind of libellous email or somesuch despite the company having implemented email disclaimers. pay no heed to this - its just a rumour (http://www.weblaw.co.uk/artemail.htm).Anyway, please: Email exel.com!!!> kevinNB: This email is copyright 2002 Paul Jakma.

I have you down for $61 plus shipping, not $1,600.  I show that you bid at $6.99 and at $61.  There was no bid for $19.99 listed at all.  I am sorry if you did not mean to bid $61, but it is hardly out of the range - these balls were selling this weekend for $80-90.  If your winning bid was $200 or higher I could understand your complaint and we could make an adjustment, but $61 is not an unreasonable amount.  Please let me know if you are planning on paying the $61(I will pay shipping if you use PayPal).  If not, I need to contact EBay for resolution.  I need a response as soon as possible.  Thanks.

Cole's on Waugh To add to the next Newsletter:  Julie,  My partner and I have not been very visable at any of the local meetings,   however we ALWAYS anxiously await the next installment of the newsletter.  We  have been extremely busy making the house we bought  on Bomar liveable,  it  was barely that way when we bought it.  We wanted to add to your restaurant review.  Cole's on Waugh is a fairly decent restaurant with an OK menu.   The Garlic  soup was a definite hit,  and the atmosphere was great.  The wine list is  good and the prices were very reasonable. The entrees need a bit of work,  the beef was very ""Gamey"", the chicken  dishes were dry,  and the fried shrimp were a bit greasy.     All things aside we have eaten there three times,  and deem it worth while.   We have seen the menu and service improve with each visit.  Our hope is that  if enough people visit Cole's the menu will improve.  It is in a very  convenient location and the owners and staff are very friendly.
