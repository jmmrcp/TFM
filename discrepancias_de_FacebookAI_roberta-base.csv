I am Mr.Cheung Pui,director of operations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd,Sai Wan Ho Branch.I have a business proposal for you.  Before the U.S and Iraqi war,our client Major Fadi Basem who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war early this year. Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the Major and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.  After further investigation it was also discovered that Major Fadi Basem did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Twenty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the  laws of my country at the expiration 3 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem so that you will be able to receive his funds.   WHAT IS TO BE DONE:  I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary documents that will back you up as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem,all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the transfer of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.  There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue.Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me,25%for you,and 5% for any expenses incurred during the course of the operation. Should you be interested please send me your full names and current residential address and I will prefer you to reach me on the email address: cheung_pui1@hotmail.ro  Once i get your response to co-operate,i shall provide you with more details of this operation.

This is not so much ""clear"" as ""completely different"", but yes, that is the principle meaning of the word ""materials"" and the ony logical reason why the author would've used the term here.  A court is going to consider what the apparent intent was -- not try to stretch the meaning beyond the obvious.  > Would you expect an art *materials* catalogue to...  Hereafter, you are trying to stretch the meaning to something that it obviously wasn't intended to mean.  You can do that, because the license is POORLY WRITTEN. Which I have already said. Miraculously, you and I appear to AGREE on that point.  One consequence of this is that some lawyer might try to play the same games with the language that you are doing here.  I think the court would laugh in his face, but who knows?  > I'm trying to understand how it is possible to claim that compilers > don't fit the meaning of materials there  That would be by using the *normal*, *first* definition of ""materials"" and not some alternate meaning that has come about by association.  There is also the point that it wouldn't make any sense to require the meaning you are attempting to press: is there even a compiler which can be ""released in source format under conditions of this license""? If not, then it stands to reason that the author, knowing this, cannot have intended to limit compilation to such a hypothetical compiler. This is yet more evidence for an intent which agrees with the obvious interpretation of the language.  So, are you saying you honestly believe the author's intent was to block compilation of changes to his package altogether? If so, why distribute source at all? Furthermore, you believe that having this irrational intent, he then tried to hide it by using a word which *might* be interpreted to support his intent, but whose most obvious meaning contradicts it?  I find that a pretty implausible theory.  Your interpretation is distorts the license's original intent by using alternate meanings of words. As such it may even be semantically correct (that is, it may be within the set of possible semantic meanings of the utterance), but it is pragmatically incorrect (it is not the subset of that set that was meant by the author -- as we can tell from context). Intent is a matter of pragmatics[1] -- the study of situated utterances as evidence for meaning, not semantics[2] -- the study of isolated utterances for potential meaning.  You're pounding very hard on the semantics, trying to broaden the set of possible meanings, and you're not wrong about that as far as you go, but that's missing the point. The question was not ""what could this sentence possibly mean"", but ""what did this sentence mean when the author wrote it"" -- which is what actually matters legally.  The rest of the license, the fact of using the license, the fact of releasing software with source code and the consequences of licensing choices all provide situational information which supports the pragmatic interpretation of the sentence in question.  The fact that courts (or we) have to go beyond semantics to understand the license is a serious flaw of the license, which I've already pointed out, but as evidence of the author's actual intent, I think it is sufficient.

legitimate,phishing,True,"Bike Diary #6 Day 13 Date: Thursday July 5, 2001 Distance: 85 miles Moving average speed: 13.1 mph Left at: 8:00 AM Arrived at: 4:00 PM Overnight in: cyclist shelter in Monroeville, IN Latitude 40 d 58 m 7 s N Longitude 84 d 51 m 55 s W Cumulative distance: 1058 miles  Today I passed two major milestones: I crossed another state border (Ohio to Indiana, and yes, I took that picture of the sign), and I logged my 1000th mile.  Now it's easy to extrapolate forward: if I covered 1000 miles in 13 days then I should cover 4000 miles in 52 days, which is 7 weeks and 3 days, within the range of my 6-to-8 week predeparture prediction.  52 days from my starting date (June 23) is August 13.  I would estimate the error on that prediction to be +/- 4 days, on the grounds that I added 1 day of riding to the first 1000 miles to nurse an injured knee, which extrapolates to 4 days over 4000 miles.  The weather today was fine, sunny with a high in the 70s, and the riding conditions would have been perfect were it not for the damn headwind.  It was from the northwest this time, so I could get a  little component of it behind me every time my route turned a little bit south.  But along the stretches of roads aligned due west it was a real grind.  I should digress on the subject of that headwind.  If I could have a nickel for every time somebody has told me that I am riding the ""wrong way"" across the country because the prevailing winds blow from west to east, then I would start getting invited to Bill Gates' parties.  Generally speaking, my interlocutors do not even appreciate the full difficulty of riding from east to west, because not only are the prevailing winds against you, but so are the prevailing hills.  You may recall from a previous Bike Diary entry my discussion of why it is that one should always prefer to go gradually down hill as opposed to an exhilerating rapid descent that squanders all the energy gained from climbing into wind resistance (this is not my opinion, it is a fact of physics).  Well, if you think about it, Denver is a mile high (5000 feet above sea level), but still east of the Front Range of the Rockies.  The Mississippi River, on the other hand, is only a few hundred feet above sea level.  This is true everywhere as you approach the Rockies from the east (for example, Cut Bank, MT on my route is just short of 4000 feet elevation).  Therefore, going west across the great plains you are gradually climbing, only to rapidly descend again when you get across the continental divide. The eastbounders, on the other hand, get the benefit of playing out their altitude gain gradually over a long distance as they descend across the great plains.  So, why go west?  Personally, I feel that flying to the west coast and bicycling back is the moral equivalent of getting air lifted to the top of Everest, skiing down to the base camp and then claiming to have climbed the mountain.  It is as if you wanted the bragging rights to say you rode your bicycle across the country, but you wanted to obtain them with the least amount of exertion necessary.  If you live on the east coast, and you want to ride across the continent, it seems perfectly obvious to me that what you need to do is ride west.  One should not undertake such a project as this if you want to do something easy.  OK, end of tirade.  Just remember this the next time you meet someone who claims to have bicycled across the country: the westbounders are the real cyclists.  Speaking of westbounders, I may be closing in on some ahead of me. I stopped in at the bicycle store in Defiance, OH to see if they had any news of westbounders.  Apparently a couple, short in stature, had passed through four days ago.  I wonder if this is the same couple making a perimeter tour that I heard about from the scruffy eastbounder on route 20 in upstate NY (see Day 4, Bike Diary #2).  If so, they were 8-9 days ahead of me then and are only 4 days ahead of me now, so I may be closing the gap.  In 10 days I've gained 4 on them, with 4 more to go, so I would guess that I will probably catch up to them in another 10 days, around July 15.  Stay tuned.  I'm spending tonight in Monroeville, IN.  Monroeville is like the set of a Frank Capra movie: you have your supper in the Village Cafe (two fried pork chops with mashed potatoes and gravy and a side salad for six bucks) and a chocolate malted from the Whippy Dip for dessert. The clientele of the Whippy Dip is a small crowd of flirting teenagers, there's a little league baseball game going on the playing field in the city park, and after dark the fireflies come out in swarms. You may have thought that places like this didn't exist any more, but here in middle America civil small town life is alive and well. You don't lock up your bike and you don't worry about it, either.  My accomodation here in Monroeville is a pavillion in the city park that has been set up as a shelter specifically for long distance touring cyclists.  There's a small bathroom with every imaginable amenity from warm shower to washer/dryer for your laundry.  The hospitable residents of Monroeville expect nothing in return: you can leave a donation but there's no obligation.  There's a guest book where you can leave your name, starting point and destination, and from the list of names it appears that Monroeville is a popular destination for touring cyclists: there's a few coming through every couple of days. I scanned the list for evidence of westbounders ahead of me to no avail.  Day 14 Date: Friday July 6, 2001 Distance: 83 miles Moving average speed: 14.1 mph Left at 7:30 AM Arrived at 2:30 PM Overnight in Salamonie River State Forest near Wabash, IN Latitude 40 d 48 m 42 s N Longitude 85 d 41 m 53 s W Cumulative distance: 1141  Although I rode 83 miles today, I only advanced 56 along the route to Seattle.  There were two reasons for the extra 27 miles today, the first was an inadvertent detour first thing in the morning when I left Monroeville headed in the wrong direction.  Here's and important fact for you future trans-America cyclists to remember: the sun rises in the east and sets in the west.  Therefore, if you are navigating the midwestern grid on a sunny morning thinking that you are going west but you do not see your shadow in front of you, then something is terribly wrong. It took me about three or four miles to notice this discrepancy, miles which I had to double back, of course.  The second detour was up to Fort Wayne to pick up some mail that my friends Maria and Kate sent me (thanks Kate! thanks Maria!).  I love mail.  The rest of the day was full of county roads and cornfields in Indiana. The wind more or less behaved itself today, starting the morning from the southeast before settling back into its usual pattern of coming from the southwest.  It wasn't much of a wind in either direction, maybe 5-10 mph.  I could easily have made it a longer day, but there is a real scarcity of services along this particular stretch of the route.  The next campground is 38 miles farther on, and there isn't a motel in the next 87 miles.  I probably could have managed the 38 miles to the next campground, but in deference to my still aching knees I quit much earlier in the afternoon than I would normally.  It looks like I made an impressively early start today, but that turns out to be a bit of a trick.  Although most of Indiana is in the eastern time zone, the state does not observe daylight savings time (except for the part in the cental time zone, just for maximum confusion) so at this time of year I crossed into the central time zone for all practical purposes when I crossed the Indiana border.  My campground tonight is a ""primitive facility"" which translates to no shower and pit toilets.  Generally speaking, I don't much mind primitive campgrounds as they are generally alot emptier than the ones that cater to the RV crowd and provide full hookups (water and electrical).  This one is an exception to that rule: there's hardly a vacant site.  I suppose it must be because of the holiday weekend since there isn't anything terribly exciting to do in the neighborhood. Most of the other campers are sitting in their sites experimenting  with all the noise-making gear they have brought along (firecrackers, car stereos, bongo drums, you name it).  Oh well, after all these days on the road I think I could sleep through anything.  Day 15 Date: Saturday July 7, 2001 Distance: 86 miles Moving average speed: 12.1 mph Left at 9:30 AM Arrived at 6:15 PM Overnight in White House B&B in Rensselaer, IN Latitude 40 d 55 m 52 s N Longitude 87 d 9 m 6 s W Cumulative distance: 1227 miles  I awoke this morning at 5 AM (EST) to the sound of distant thunder.  At first, I didn't realize that it was thunder I was hearing.  I'm accustomed to thunder as an intermitent booming; the sound I hear this morning was a continuous background.  After I had ruled out military aircraft on manueovers as a possible source for the sound I heard, I realized that I was in big trouble.  My immediate thought was ""strike the tent and seek shelter"".  That probably seems strange to alot of people who figure that the tent IS shelter, but you may recall from my first night's experience that if the tent is pitched on a slope, then it provides precious little shelter from runoff soaking through the floor of the tent.  I had once again pitched the tent on a slope, not expecting rain.  In fact, it seemed that most of the folks in the campground were not expecting (or at least prepared for) the rain that came.  By 6 AM I had my gear stowed my gear and loaded on the bicycle, and I moved myself and the bicycle to the only shelter on the campground: a pavillion that protected, ironically enough, the campground's water supply. The water supply itself was nothing but a spigot, but it spilled into a catch basin that looked like it came out of a coroner's office: it was a shallow sink no wider than usual but long enough to lay down in.  The pavillion overhangs this sink by three or four feet on any side, therefore the entire sheltered area was no bigger than about eight by ten feet.  At 6:10 AM the rains came with a vengance.  I cannot remember the last time I saw such torrential rain and so much lightning.  I believe that more than four inches of rain fell during the next three and a half hours, with lightning hitting very close to where I was standing.  I now could under- stand why the distant thunder had been continuous, because I was now standing in the middle of it.  And there I stood, for about three and a half hours, making light conversation with some of the other campers who dared step out in the storm and waiting for it to end.  One guy seemed to have an unnaturally detailed knowledge of the roads and motels of Indiana; when I asked him what line of work he was in he said he was following power lines.  Apparently utilities hire these guys to go around the state following the power lines to make sure there are no trees nearby that threaten to fall on them.  At 9:30 AM it was clear that the worst of the storm had passed and I decided to head out and make the most of what was left of the day. I'm pretty much ready to get out of Indiana, having already spent more time crossing Ohio than I had hoped.  The day started out as a more or less routine one of grinding out miles across cornfields.  The wind was quite strong in the aftermath of the storm, but it had returned to its normal direction (southwest), so I concluded that the rain was probably over for the day.  The weather was hot and humid, and the pace pretty slow.  I ran into some eastbounders in Denver, IN.  I wouldn't have recognized them as tourists because they were travelling on unloaded bikes, but one of them stopped to talk to me.  They are a group of three men in their late 50s/early 60s doing the Northern Tier in sections while somebody's wife drives the camper/sag-wagon behind.  Boy, these guys have it easy: not only are they eastbound but supported as well!  And he had the nerve to complain to me about headwinds!  ""Take a look at that flag"" I said.  My goal for today after I realized that it would be abbreviated by rain was to make it to Rensselaer, IN.  I'm passing through a part of Indiana where the campgrounds are scarce (and so is the population), so I had to shoot for a town with a motel.  Upon, arriving in Rensselaer, I was greeted by a parade of hot-rods (in fact, some locals had stopped me about two miles from town to warn me that it was happening today). I would estimate that there was well over one hundred cars in the parade, and after it was over they proceeded to cruise the town revving engines and peeping tires much to the delight of the townsfolk, who had turned out to the last man to observe the spectacle.  I suppose this is some sort of July Forth weekend event that happens every year.  I ended up picking the B&B for the night since the only other option was a motel on the interstate.  It might have been cheaper, but I would really hate staying on an interstate strip four miles outside of town.  At least this way I could walk around town and watch the cars go by.  I think I was making slightly better time on foot than the cruisers were, but maybe that's their point.",0

Email: paulotobo2@walla.com                                             Dear Sir,  It is my great pleasure to write you this letter on behalf of my colleagues. Your information were given to me by a member of the South African Export Promotion Council (SAEPC) who was with the Black Economic Empowerment Commission (Government) delegation on a trip to the United States during a bilateral conference talk to encourage foreign investors. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in execution of a deal hereunder for the benefit of all parties, and hope you will keep it confidential because of the nature of this business.  Within the Department of Mining Resources where I work as the Director of Project Implementation, with co-operation of two other top officials, we have in our possession, an overdue payment in US funds.  The said funds represent certain percentage of the contract value executed on behalf of my Ministry by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced to the amount of US$41,500,000.00 (Forty One Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). Though the actual contract cost has been paid to the original contractor, leaving the excess balance unclaimed.  The Government of the Republic of South Africa believe that private investment in general, and foreign direct investment in particular, are the real engines for sustainable economic development, for which reason it has continued to encouraged investment in the key growth-oriented sector of Mining with sincere determination to pay foreign contractors all debts owed to them, so as to continue to enjoy close relationship, and mutually beneficial co-operation with foreign governments and non-governmental financial agencies. As a result we included our bills for approvals with the co-operation of some officials at the Department of Finance and the Reserve Bank of South Africa (RBSA). We are seeking your assistance to be the beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, since we are not allowed to operate foreign account. The changing of beneficiary's information/ details and other forms of documentation upon application for claim to reflect the contract money and its approvals will be secured on behalf of your company or your self.  I have the authority of my colleagues involved to propose that, should you be willing to assist us in this transaction your share as compensation will be 20% while my colleagues and I shall receive 70%, and the balance of 10% shall be used to reimburse all expenditures, taxes and miscellaneous expenses so incurred.  It does not matter whether or not your company does contract projects of the nature described here. The assumption is that your company won the major contract and subcontracted it to other companies. More often than not, big trading companies and firms of unrelated fields win major contracts, and subcontract to more specialized firms for execution.  This business itself is 100% safe, provided you treat it with utmost confidentiality. Also your specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this mutual beneficiary transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint us. Kindly notify me for further details, upon your acceptance of this proposal.Pls send  all correspondence to potobo1@netscape.net  Regards, Engr Paul O. Otobo. potobo1@netscape.net",1

legitimate,phishing,True,"RE: Transok Offsystem Fuel Accounting Procedure 	I have reviewed to orders issued by FERC.  They state ""Pipelines acquiring upstream capacity without prior Commission approval will be ""at-risk"" for the cost of that capacity"".  This means that Northern will need to track both the costs and revenues associated with offsystem transactions.  We believe that in tracking the revenues we can track by contract.    	Therefore, I believe in the meeting that if we needed to track these transactions Sue's group would maintain a manual spreadsheet for all off-system transactions.  	We also said Dan Fancler would need to review and determine how we would track the revenues thru the accounting side.    	I believe we have provided the answers we committed to in the meeting yesterday for today.  I plan to meet with Lynn B. tomorrow to discuss nominations, contract approval processes and other stuff.....  I'll let you know where we are as things develop.  thanks MW   -----Original Message----- From: 	Fancler, Dan   Sent:	Thursday, October 11, 2001 2:38 PM To:	Winckowski, Michele; Kirk, Steve; Miller, Kent; Neville, Sue; Williams, Jo; Blair, Lynn Cc:	Cobb Jr., John; Chandler, Bob; Kissner, Tim; Brennan, Patrick Subject:	Transok Offsystem Fuel Accounting Procedure  Based on our meeting 10/9/2001, I would like to propose the following accounting procedures for expensing in-kind fuel.  Case A:  In October 500,000 dts moves offsystem with only 486,000 dts expected to be returned to NNG in January.  NNG moves 500,000 dts from physical inventory to Offsystem inventory. No accounting entry made to the G/L.  Gas Accounting would reduce Offsystem inventory 14,000 dts to reflect in-kind fuel reduction in the same month the next NNG gas purchase transaction occurs (FIFO inventory method).  Reducing the Offsystem storage will cause UAF to increase, however purchasing gas for Operational Storage and not recording it to Operational Storage will offset the UAF increase.  If the next gas purchase transaction occurs in December at $3.00 then we would reduce Offsystem Storage Inventory by 14,000 dts in December production.  December UAF would not be affected.  Recorded in December: Debit 858 3rd Party Transport exp		14,000 * $3.00 = $42,000 	Credit A/P							($42,000)  Procedural Note:  All Third Party Offsystem storage statements must be forwarded to Gas Accounting (Dan Fancler) in order to reconcile the Physical to the Books.  Reconciling items such as in-kind fuel reductions will be reported to Storage Marketing noting that purchases for in-kind fuel replacements are needed.  If NNG purchases 100,000 dt for Operational Storage in December, then 14,000 dts would be carved out as in-kind fuel replacement and recorded to 858 (3rd party transport), the remaining 86,000 dts would be recorded as Operational Storage purchase and encroachment.  We may wish for the vender to issue two invoices.   Case B	 In October 500,000 dts moves offsystem, NNG purchases the in-kind replacement on Transok's system and 500,000  dts is expected to be returned to NNG in January.  NNG moves 500,000 dts from physical inventory to Offsystem inventory. No accounting entry made to the G/L. NNG does not reduce the offsystem physical inventory.  Recorded in month of purchase on Transok's system: Debit 858 3rd Party Transport exp		14,000 * $3.00 = $42,000 	Credit A/P							($42,000)  In both cases all transactions are recorded outside of operational storage, but gives Marketing some flexibility on when the in-kind replacement takes place but still follows a logical methodology (FIFO replacement).",0

I am interested in doing business with your humble self, but before I proceed further, I want you to please note that this is not a sort of joke, I mean business.  I want to invest heavily in your country and other countries within your geographical zone as you may indicate as ideal.

As you may wish to know, I am the director of P.P.M.C (Petroleum Products Marketing Company); a subsidiary of Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation,CC N.N.P.C. My office is in charge of selling crude oil to foreign companies/countries that come to lift or buy oil as well as registering and certifying each and every one of them before a single barrel is lifted.   As a result of the recent upsurge in the price of crude oil, I and some of my colleague make 30 cent on a barrel and for over the period of 2 months, we had realized US$50 M (FIFTY MILLION US DOLLARS). As civil servants getting this money out of my country (Nigeria) for investment poses a problem, following the fact that Government officials are prohibited from running a foreign account, and as such, I crave your indulgence to assist in this regard, if you wish to assist, kindly mail me back. So we could go in to business. Please Email me your response to my personal box:  (drgodianokocha@myway.com)   As the transaction progress, you stand the chance to negotiate what your cut will be from the US$50 M (FIFTY MILLION US DOLLARS).

legitimate,phishing,True,"[Ip-health] WSJ: trade deal a small step for generics -- [ Picked text/plain from multipart/alternative ] In Trade Deal, a Shift on Generics  *Agreement Opens the Door To Cheaper Drugs Abroad,  Easing Some Patent Rules *  *By SARAH LUECK*  *Wall Street Journal, **May 17, 2007; Page A4*  WASHINGTON -- A new trade agreement between Congress and the White House contains provisions that open the door to more sales of generic drugs in developing countries. The plan, reversing earlier gains for American drug makers backed by President Bush, marks the first big setback for the pharmaceutical industry since Democrats claimed Capitol Hill.  For now, the provisions likely only affect pending trade deals with Peru, Panama and Colombia. But the plan also signals a broader shift as congressional leaders give greater weight in trade talks to providing cheaper medicines for the poor, even if it means denying the Republican-friendly drug industry some of the protection it says it needs.  The administration ""has permitted the weakening of intellectual-property protections in these agreements,"" said Billy Tauzin, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the drug industry's main trade group, in an interview. ""They were desperate to get continuing trade authority"" from Democrats in Congress, he said. ""The fact is, their leverage changed since November.""  The main focus of the bipartisan trade deal, announced last week, involves requiring U.S. trade partners to meet new standards for giving their workers labor rights and ensuring environmental protections. But the deal also allows developing countries more flexibility in dealing with U.S. drug makers than they would have had under earlier versions.  Specifically, the policy would ease requirements on developing-country regulators to prevent the sale of patent-infringing products. It also releases trading partners from a requirement to extend the time for patent protections as a form of compensation for delays in drug approvals.  Public-health advocacy groups have argued for years that U.S. trade policy under Mr. Bush often protected brand-name drug makers at the expense of poor countries in need of more-affordable treatments. Many of those groups said they weren't satisfied with last week's deal. Even with the changes, they say, the Peru and Panama deals advance many of the protections the drug industry wants -- just fewer than would have existed if the Bush administration had stuck with its earlier trade stance.  *""Compared to the many steps backward that have been taken since 2003, this is a bit of relief for people who want access to affordable medicines,"" said Ellen Shaffer, co-director of the Center for Policy Analysis on Trade and Health in San Francisco. ""Compared to an actual policy that would provide affordable medicines for people and fairly balance that with innovation, it is a small step forward.""*  Trade is just one of many fronts where the pharmaceutical industry faces a less friendly policy environment, after enjoying strong support during years of undivided Republican rule. Some Democrats want to rewrite the Medicare prescription-drug benefit to allow the government to negotiate lower prices with manufacturers. Some Democrats also want to legalize imports of cheaper medications from Canada and other countries. The Bush administration has maintained its support for the industry on those issues, and the Senate has blocked those policy changes.  But on exports, the administration last week changed course. For the last several years, U.S. trade officials and drug companies have worked to push new protections for drug makers in countries such as signers of the Central American Free Trade Agreement.  Companies say stronger safeguards for their patents and proprietary data are needed in many countries, to delay generic competition and make it worthwhile for the industry to continue to invest in research and development of new treatments.  Under the new American trade strategy, the biggest loss for the industry is a change that may shift more responsibility to drug makers for preventing the marketing of patent-infringing products.  Under recent trade agreements, the U.S. pressed countries to agree to ""linkage,"" which requires local drug regulators to make sure a generic product doesn't violate any patents before allowing it on the market. Public-health advocacy groups have said this puts makers of brand-name drugs at an advantage and burdens regulators. Drug companies support linkage because it prevents copies of their products from being sold during lengthy court battles. Without it, companies will have to be more vigilant. To take industry concerns into account, the new policy calls for countries to set up fast procedures for resolving patent disputes.  Another change in the new trade policy would weaken a common provision in past trade agreements: that local regulators ""shall"" compensate drug makers for delays in the process of approving their products, by awarding extra time to sell their products free from competition.  Some Democrats said this unfairly penalizes consumers in those countries for slow bureaucracies. A description of the changes to the Peru and Panama agreements says countries ""may"" extend a company's patent to make up for delays, suggesting more flexibility on what they are required to do to compensate drug makers.  Health-advocacy groups complain the new policy still preserves the data-exclusivity provision used to block generic competition. In many countries, including the U.S., makers of generic drugs can often win approval by proving their products are equivalent to the original drugs. In that process, regulators use test data submitted by makers of brand-name drugs. The data-exclusivity provision typically prevents such use of the data for five years, acting as an effective hurdle for generics. The new policy does, however, place more restrictions on the five-year data exclusivity than previously existed in the Panama and Peru agreements.  *Write to *Sarah Lueck at sarah.lueck@wsj.com1    *URL for this article: http://online.wsj.com/article/SB117936226237705632.html*    *Hyperlinks in this Article: (1) mailto:sarah.lueck@wsj.com  *   -- Ellen R.

You have to make sure your locale is set to ja_JP.UTF-8  and you need to  make sure that kinput2 is working properly. This will involve having  kinput2 and cannaserver both running.  Here is more information:  http://dspnet.fr/~lonewolf/LinuxJapan/Howto_English_Japanese.html  Make sure that the XMODIFIERS environment variable is set such as this  XMODIFIERS=""@im=kinput2""  Then you can test input first using notepad.  run ~/cxoffice/bin/wine  notepad then try inputing Japanese into notepad.

I understand that argument, but I do think it requires a leap of logic (or at least some creative interpretation) to get from the DFSG to this position. While I can see why some people do not want CDDL-licensed software in main for the above reason, I do not think it is fair to call it the Debian position that this is the case; at least not yet.  Counter-arguments: * The bit ""(except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides   otherwise)"" means you don't necessarily have to give up all your   rights. There are parts of copyright law in most jurisdictions that   give unalienable rights to users; those fall under the above   provision, by definition. The net result of your first clause   therefore may be, depending on circumstances, that users actually get   _more_ rights than what they started out with if that provision wasn't   there, because their own copyright law doesn't give them nearly as   much rights as the copyright law in the country where the software was   written would. * Your second quote is a non-issue. The same is true for GPL-licensed   software; if not, then why did we have to consult two lawyers back   when we moved crypto to main? And why do we still have such insane   procedures today when some crypto-using software gets through NEW?   (you don't see them because ftp-masters handle them, but they're still   there).  Additionally, personally I don't think it's unreasonable for people to say ""if you use my software in a way that I didn't want you to, I'll sue you in a court that works by a set of rules that I'm actually comfortable with"". You know, it makes fighting those who do not follow your license the way you intended them to quite a bit easier.  --  Shaw's Principle: 	Build a system that even a fool can use, and only a fool will 	want to use it.   --  To UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org with a subject of ""unsubscribe"".

Fresh news has  made  VNBL a hot buy.   NEWS ON VNBL   MALIBU, Ca|if.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 16, 2O05--Vinob|e, Inc.  (OTCBB:VNBL -  News), a holding company seeking to identify |ong-term growth  opportunities  in the areas of homeland security, security information systems, and  other  security services, announced today that it plans to offer products and  services that wi|| assist in the automation of the identification and  contro| of equipment, assets, too|s, and the re|ated processes used in  the  Oil & Gas and Petrochemical industries.  Although smal| wireless|y networked RFID sensors can monitor machines  and  equipment to detect possib|e prob|ems before they become serious, they  can  also de|iver safety features within oil we|ls. Oil maybe trapped in  different layers of rock, a|ong with gas and water. Detection of  specific  liquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise  opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur,  such as  a we|l filling with water.  As with other RF based techno|ogy applications, RFID can a|so provide  the  safe transit of materia|s by on|y the authorized handler, and limit the  entry of personne| to specific |ocations. Ensuring personnel safety is  essential, shou|d there be an emergency at a faci|ity, RFID tags would  enab|e the customer to track and evaluate its employee's safety and/or  danger. This app|ication technology requires product and hardware that  can  operate in harsh and potential|y hazardous conditions, but gives  valuable  safety to the resources and assets that are vital to the customer. RFID  can  a|so assist the customer's supp|y chain by tracking oi|, gas, and  chemica|  products from extraction to refining to the sale at the retail level.  Vinob|e's viewpoint as previously stated is that these applications are  more  than just a va|uable tool to the mining industry, but as a protective  measure of our country's natura| resources and commodities against  threat.  Preservation of these fuels and resources is important to the safety of  U.S.  industry and economy.  The Company believes that such offering service and technology  application  in the Oil & Gas and Petrochemica| industry wi|| further position  Vinob|e in  a rapid|y expanding industry whi|e taking advantage of access to the  increasing capital and global spending that the Company will require  for  growth. The Company's goa| is to a|so provide a much-needed service at  a  cost manageable to even the sma|lest of businesses that can't afford to  do  without the safety of its personne| and assets in this current state of  constant threat.   This is Outstanding news.  The growth potentia| for this company is  exceptiona|.  In an already hot industry, VNBL.OB stands out as a truly  innovative pioneer.

To customize, reschedule, or turn off these reports please click here  Player Updates NFL Reports 	    Latest NFL Player News Ricky Watters , RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 According to the Tacoma News Tribune, Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. ""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stret! ch! . Trent Dilfer , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point. Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 10/23/01 Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck fr! om! a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week. Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 10/23/01 The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams. Dedric Ward , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season. Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Neal/McKay Updated 10/23/01 Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week. Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week. Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Tori U! pd! ated 10/23/01 Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use him this week. Terrence Wilkins , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week. Terrell Davis , RB DEN - JWillie Updated 10/23/01 Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they will activate h! im! . He will work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Martin Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice until late in the week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota.  Duce Staley , RB PHI - Giggles Updated 10/23/01 Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on 11 carries l! at! e in the game. At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a solid replacement.  Joe Nedney , K TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week.  Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Kinney will be listed on the injury report because of a calf injury. However, he is expected to play in this week's game.  Kevin Dyson , WR TEN - Bass/Hull Updated 10/23/01 Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice. Eddie George , RB TEN - Tori Updated 10/23/01 George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in this week's game.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Martin Updated 10/23/01 McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game.  Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence.  Damon Jones , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery.  Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Martin Updated 10/23/01 Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's game remains uncertain. ""All I know is that, from week to week, they increase his exercises and change of direction,"" head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. ""It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week."" Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23.  Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to action next week.  Todd Heap , TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle.  Terry Allen , RB BAL - Tori Updated 10/23/01 Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at running back if Allen is inactive.  Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Tori Updated 10/23/01 Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. ""I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest area,"" Grbac said Monday. ""There could be something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see."" Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unable to play.  Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Neal/McKay Updated 10/23/01 Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orleans.  Trung Canidate , RB STL - Giggles Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. ""I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game,"" coach Mike Martz said. ""He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play."" Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week.  J.J. Stokes , WR SF - Matty Updated 10/23/01 Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close to being completely healthy. ""Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was a blessing for me because I was ab! le! to get treatment every day,"" Stokes told the Contra Costa Times . ""I practiced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close."" Stokes has been less than mediocre, however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to be more reliable.  Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - Russell Updated 10/23/01 Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants' starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed.  Ron Dixon , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day.  Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Matty Updated 10/23/01 According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. ""I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago,"" Martz said. ""I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play."" Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to go.

Subject:	RE: Discussion of California Background & Issues Bob -- For certain we are seeking to not have the 1 c/kwh Surcharge post March 2002.  I think that I would be happy to begin to try and get the CPUC to modify their Order right now, but my real concern (maybe unfounded) is that we don't want the CPUC to go all the way back to Jan 4 and refund the 1c/kwh to Direct Access customers.  I thought this would harm EES given our de-dasr activities?  This is what I mean by ""finessing"" the issue too much.  The only legitimate positions are no application back to Jan 4 or to fight for a clean-up after the retail rate freeze ends. I make this based on the following.  First, it is hard for EES to push much at the CPUC.  Second, after the CPUC takes what will be a potentially direct access killing action on Aug 23, I don't think they are going to be interested in dealing with a ""detail"" that matters for only for direct access customers.  Finally, I need to understand the value of this effort in line with the other key value drivers - and also, are you completely sure that there isn't a change (however unforseen) that could hurt another of our positions.  Let's not create a fuss if the outcome could be harmful. I'm ready to push for this, but I want to make sure that everyone on the business side understands the issues.

I understand that argument, but I do think it requires a leap of logic (or at least some creative interpretation) to get from the DFSG to this position. While I can see why some people do not want CDDL-licensed software in main for the above reason, I do not think it is fair to call it the Debian position that this is the case; at least not yet.  Counter-arguments: * The bit ""(except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides   otherwise)"" means you don't necessarily have to give up all your   rights. There are parts of copyright law in most jurisdictions that   give unalienable rights to users; those fall under the above   provision, by definition. The net result of your first clause   therefore may be, depending on circumstances, that users actually get   _more_ rights than what they started out with if that provision wasn't   there, because their own copyright law doesn't give them nearly as   much rights as the copyright law in the country where the software was   written would. * Your second quote is a non-issue. The same is true for GPL-licensed   software; if not, then why did we have to consult two lawyers back   when we moved crypto to main? And why do we still have such insane   procedures today when some crypto-using software gets through NEW?   (you don't see them because ftp-masters handle them, but they're still   there).  Additionally, personally I don't think it's unreasonable for people to say ""if you use my software in a way that I didn't want you to, I'll sue you in a court that works by a set of rules that I'm actually comfortable with"". You know, it makes fighting those who do not follow your license the way you intended them to quite a bit easier.  --  Shaw's Principle: 	Build a system that even a fool can use, and only a fool will 	want to use it.   --  To UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org with a subject of ""unsubscribe"".

However, weak market fundamentals, including a sluggish economy and increased  US and Canadian supplies, will mitigate the usual winter price rise. CERA  expects an average Henry Hub price of $2.35 in November.  *  Although inventories are close to record levels, storage pressures are  increasingly unlikely to drive cash markets down significantly this year.   *  Gas demand will average 14 percent lower than a year earlier; residential  and commercial sectors show a decline with a return to normal weather, while a  weak economy offsets the return of ammonia and dual-fuel loads in the  industrial sector.  *  Regional storage inventories and weak regional demand should keep upward  pressure off of regional differentials.

Also, there is a vicious rumour going round that a year or so ago a rather large company in the UK lost a court case where an employee sent out some kind of libellous email or somesuch despite the company having implemented email disclaimers. pay no heed to this - its just a rumour (http://www.weblaw.co.uk/artemail.htm).Anyway, please: Email exel.com!!!> kevinNB: This email is copyright 2002 Paul Jakma.

But former CIA Director George Tenet lets loose in our first story in a public venting rare for any public official, never mind a CIA director. Tenet angrily accuses the Bush administration of ruining his reputation by misusing his now-famous ""slam dunk"" remark about Iraqi WMD to justify its march to war. ""It's the most despicable thing that ever happened to me,"" Tenet says. ""You don't do this. You don't throw somebody overboard just because it's a deflection. Is that honorable? It's not honorable to me,"" he tells correspondent Scott Pelley.  He also reveals in this double-length segment his anguish and frustration over the 9/11 attack, the first of the president's inner circle to provide a glimpse inside it during what many would consider the country's darkest hour in modern times. You'll hear and see his feelings on the hunt for Osama bin Laden, the war on terror and its ""enhanced interrogation"" methods he says were not torture and saved lives. Pressed by Pelley to explain why, if it wasn't torture,  these individuals had to have their interrogations ""enhanced,"" Tenet, leans forward to respond, ""Because these are people who will never, ever, ever tell you a thing. These are people who know who's responsible for the next terrorist attack....[who] wouldn't blink an eyelash about killing you, your family, me and my family and everybody in this town.""          Watch  An Excerpt Of Pelley's Report.     With the questions still hovering over the massacre at Virginia Tech last week, correspondent Steve Kroft explores perhaps the biggest irony in the horrible event. It's the fact that Seung-Hui Cho, with a history of mental illness, was still able to purchase the guns he used to kill 32 innocent people, despite a 40-year-old federal law prohibiting the sale of guns to the mentally ill. Kroft reports that the law isn't enforced because many states have laws that protect the privacy of the mentally ill, advocates for whom still want their records sealed and not shared with other government agencies. Even the NRA won't go that far. The sad fact is that Cho wasn't the first mentally ill person to kill with a gun he purchased freely, nor will he be likely the last.     Watch  Kroft's Reporter's Notebook.     These stories and some interesting items from Andy Rooney's mail bag, this Sunday, April 29, on 60 Minutes at 7 p.m. ET/PT.

phishing,legitimate,True,"CONFIDENTIAL DR.TUNJI OWO Zenith Bank Ltd,Lagos,Nigeria, Private Tel:234-80-2354-6330.  Dear Friend, I am DR.TUNJI OWO.The Manager Zenith Bank, Lagos, Nigeria.  I have urgent and-ery confidential business proposition for you. On April 6, 1996, a Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr.Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for some months, valued at S$29,500,000.00 (Twenty Nine Million Five hundred Thousand Dollars only) in my branch. Upon maturity,I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month,we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers,the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Barry Kelly died on 1 February 1997 in a plane crash on air senegal on aircraft Name Hawker Siddeley HS-748. This crash happened in Tambacoumba, Senegal, Africa and the registration  number of the aircraft is 6AV-AEO, and since his untimely death the funds has been dormant in his account with my Bank without any claim of the fund On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$29,500,000.00 has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for safe-keeping.No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law,at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as an Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money I deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes though the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as I tagged them to be photographic materials for export.   am writing you because I as a public servant, we can not operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than $1m.I want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney.All these are to make sure that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney willprepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the as the owner of the boxes. The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 25% for you and 5% will take care of all expenses.There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantee the successful execution of this transaction. f you are interested, please reply immediately via my email address. upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe with utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.

E-MAIL ; mm_m_17johnson@yahoo.com.au  DEAR SIR,  Compliments of the day,I understand quite well that this message will sound so strange to you but it is a very serious matter that we need to tackle together very urgent. Before i proceed further,Let me formally introduce myself to you .I am MR. JOHNSON MUGABE, 30 years of age, the first adopted son of president Robert Mugabe, the current Zimbabwean President. I am contacting you today for an urgent assistance to transfer into your account the sum of US$ 19.8 ( NINTEEN POINT EIGHT MILION STATES DOLLARS).  I hope that you may be aware of the recent differences that is going on rigth now between my father and the opposition party in my country, this also brought about the commonwealth community sanctioning my father and freezing all his foreign account both in America and britain.This decision was carried out during the 4 days Commonwealth meeting that was held in Malawi in a part of South East Africa recently.  It will interest you to hear that i never supported my fathers treatment to the white zimbabwean citizens, and this has seriously brought about some personal misunderstanding between me and my father.I have been opposing him since the past five (7) years. Fight so hard to see that he leaves the presidential seat after governing for past 32 years On this account i disassociated myself from him and we do not have any thing in common right now.He even forced me to leave the country with immediate effect after receiving the sanction from the common wealth community, Although he thought that i am behind his delimma. In the year 2004 when i was in good term with my father, he gave me a treasure box containing the sum of US$19.8 milion to deposite in a private security company in Thailand for safe keeping, So i did exactly as he instructed me without disclosing the actual content of the box to the security company,every documents was signed and documented in my names and details.This money has been lying in the security company for the past 8 months.  Now that he sent me out on exile, i left zimbabwe to Thailand where i am currently seeking political assylum.My aim of travelling to Thailand was to claim the money and transfer it out of Thailand to any other country that will be safe for investment. I am contacting you therefore on the account that you will support me to secure the fund in good condition and also come over to Thailand so that we can both claim the fund together, and then we travel down to your country for proper investment of the fund.  I have visited the security company and made every neccessary enquiry concerning the fund and it is still intact in the security house.I will compensate you with 7%of the total sum (i.e US$ 1,386 000.00) and i have set aside another 8% (i.e US$1,584 000.00) for any expenses that may be incured during the transaction. Please this is a very confidential matter that needs utmost secrecy and confidentiality, so i am really pleading to you to try as much as possible to keep every aspect of this confidential. Please also do not reveal it to any one as my hope and futture solely depend on this money and if you are willing to work with me and assist me on this transaction,then do not hesitate to contact me immediately by sending me your TELEPHONE and FAX NUMBERS,and reply me through my e-mail address for us to carry on with the next step of the transaction.  Hoping to receive your positive response soonest.   BEST REGARDS,  MR. JOHNSON MUGABE",1

To customize, reschedule, or turn off these reports please click here  Player Updates NFL Reports 	    Latest NFL Player News Ricky Watters , RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 According to the Tacoma News Tribune, Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. ""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stret! ch! . Trent Dilfer , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point. Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 10/23/01 Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck fr! om! a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week. Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 10/23/01 The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams. Dedric Ward , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season. Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Neal/McKay Updated 10/23/01 Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week. Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week. Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Tori U! pd! ated 10/23/01 Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use him this week. Terrence Wilkins , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week. Terrell Davis , RB DEN - JWillie Updated 10/23/01 Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they will activate h! im! . He will work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Martin Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice until late in the week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota.  Duce Staley , RB PHI - Giggles Updated 10/23/01 Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on 11 carries l! at! e in the game. At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a solid replacement.  Joe Nedney , K TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week.  Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Kinney will be listed on the injury report because of a calf injury. However, he is expected to play in this week's game.  Kevin Dyson , WR TEN - Bass/Hull Updated 10/23/01 Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice. Eddie George , RB TEN - Tori Updated 10/23/01 George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in this week's game.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Martin Updated 10/23/01 McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game.  Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence.  Damon Jones , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery.  Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Martin Updated 10/23/01 Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's game remains uncertain. ""All I know is that, from week to week, they increase his exercises and change of direction,"" head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. ""It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week."" Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23.  Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to action next week.  Todd Heap , TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle.  Terry Allen , RB BAL - Tori Updated 10/23/01 Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at running back if Allen is inactive.  Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Tori Updated 10/23/01 Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. ""I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest area,"" Grbac said Monday. ""There could be something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see."" Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unable to play.  Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Neal/McKay Updated 10/23/01 Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orleans.  Trung Canidate , RB STL - Giggles Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. ""I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game,"" coach Mike Martz said. ""He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play."" Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week.  J.J. Stokes , WR SF - Matty Updated 10/23/01 Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close to being completely healthy. ""Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was a blessing for me because I was ab! le! to get treatment every day,"" Stokes told the Contra Costa Times . ""I practiced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close."" Stokes has been less than mediocre, however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to be more reliable.  Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - Russell Updated 10/23/01 Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants' starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed.  Ron Dixon , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day.  Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Matty Updated 10/23/01 According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. ""I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago,"" Martz said. ""I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play."" Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to go.

phishing,legitimate,True,"From: Mr.Al-Zarqawi Yusuf  From: Mr.Al-Zarqawi Yusuf  Dear Friend,  Your first reaction to this mail will be total rejection, scare and maybe disbelief, owning largely to the atrocities people commit these days.But this mail comes from a devastated, sorrowful and emotional laden soul that needs compassion from a kind and good spirited person to wipe away my tears and appropriate my dream and humanitarian gesture.  As you read this, I don't want you to  feel sorry for me, because, I believe everyone dies someday.,I am Al-Zarqawi Yusuf, A Oil merchant in Dubai, United Arab Emirate ( UAE). I have been diagnosed with Cancer, which was discovered very late, due to my laxity in caring for my health. It has defiled all forms of medicine; Right now I have only about a limited to live, according to my Medical Doctor. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for myself but the Oil business.Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.  I believe when Allah  gives me a second chance and  heal me I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it.I have sowed a seed for my healing I have willed and given most of my properties and assets to my immediate and extended family members and as well as a few close friends. i want Allah to be merciful to me and accept my soul and so, I have decided to give arms to charity organizations and give succor and comfort to the less privileged of the Tsunami and Hurricane Katrina Victims, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth so far, by distributed some of this money to some charity organizations in India,Hurricane Katrina victims in USA and other part of the world. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self anymore.I once asked members of my family  to close one of my accounts in Saudi Bank and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization and to the less  privileged in Bulgaria and Sudan.  They cashed the money but kept it only to themselves.  Hence I do not trust them anymore,as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them already.The last of my money, which no one knows of, is the huge cash deposit of Thirty Five Million United States Dollars ( US$35Million)  that I have in the Vault of The Security Company as family valuable since the year 2003 for safekeeping.I want you to collect this deposit on my behalf and disburse it to the Tsunami Earthquake victims in Asia for the less privileged. Please send me a mail to indicate your wiliness to assist in this disbursement.   I will set aside 10% for you for your time and efforts by notifying the security company as soon as i hear from you.I need your urgent reply with your full name and address, your Phone and Fax numbers and your Occupation so that I will not have to go on sourcing for a credible person to handle this project for himself and the rest of the less privileged.I will also plead to you to always pray for me because only Allah heals.   Wasaalam  Regards, Al-Zarqawi Yusuf.",1

Jon Frankel, who was a correspondent on our show, now can claim the coolest of titles: ""documentary filmmaker.""  He made a film called ""Hellfighters: a Season in Harlem,"" which will have its premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival.  The film is about the promise and struggles of a group of teenagers, brought together to play football in Harlem.  Jon's got a great eye and big heart, so I'm sure the movie is a treat to watch; I can't wait to see it.    Mark McEwen was the weatherman when I joined the show seven years ago, and he became a pal I could always count on to make me laugh, and, in turn, someone who'd laugh at my stupid jokes.      He moved to Orlando a while back, and in 2005, Mark suffered a terrible stroke. He was at the airport at the time and didn't recognize the symptoms so he kept right on traveling. The stroke ended up almost killing him. Luckily for all of us who love him, he survived, and is determined to make a full recovery. This morning he came on the show to talk about  recognizing the signs of a stroke. I cannot emphasize enough how important it is to know these signs because every moment is critical.    I know this because it happened to my mom as well -- not once, but twice. The first stroke, which happened when I was a baby, nearly killed her. The second, which struck when I was in high school, was just as severe, but thank goodness she knew the symptoms and was able to get to the hospital in time to save her life. With time, therapy, prayer and a lot of hard work, she's now fully recovered. I'm so proud of her, but it's an experience I wish no other family ever had to go through. So I'm grateful to Mark, for his openness and courage in talking about this. I'm also thankful because I had a few moments to hang out with him this morning. The last time we spoke, he had a tough time talking and I was a weepy mess. Today we were back to old form: telling stupid jokes and laughing.      Tomorrow on the Saturday Early Show, we'll have some important advice you'll want to remember the next time you use your debit card. We'll also preview some romantic summer movies, cook up a Mediterranean meal with our ""Chef on a Shoestring,"" and enjoy a live performance from rock/pop balladeer Jon McLaughlin in our Second Cup Cafe. Hope you'll join us.   ________________________________   Tracy  Smith EarlyShow@cbs.com     	 	 	Advertisement     ________________________________  ________________________________  To unsubscribe or change your subscription options, click here  .

phishing,legitimate,True,"IN GOOD FAITH  Dear Friend,  Good day to you. I may have to trouble your sense of personal achievement and reward for an opportunity properly taken advantage of.  I am Mr. Michael Ramsey, a representative and attorney to Kenneth Lay, the former chairman & CEO, Enron Corp. Industry: Energy &Natural Resources Home, presently in jail and facing trial on charges of corruption and embezzlement of funds while in Power. He deposited ($21,000,000.00) with me when he was in power as the chairman.   I am contacting you because I want you to deal with the Finance house and claim the money on my behalf since I have declared that the Funds belong to my foreign business partner. You shall also be required to assist me in investment in your country. I hope to trust you as a God fearing person who will not sit on this money when you claim it, rather assist me properly, share in this percentage, 60% to me and 40% to you. When I receive your positive response I will give you viable information relating to this project i.e. the Finance institution where the money was deposited and the required documentation that will enable you lay claims to the funds, which is very important. What I need is for you to indicate your interest that you will assist us by receiving the money on my behalf in Europe. For this, you shall be considered to be the beneficiary to the funds. The project in brief, is that the funds with which we intend to carry out our proposed investments in your country, is presently in the custody of a bank in Europe. I do not want the government of my Country to know about the money because they will believe I got the money from the sales of Enron stock when he was the Chairman & C.E.O.of Enron   Once I have your details in full, the finance institution will contact you for Release of the funds to your account. As soon as payment is effected, and the amount mentioned above is successfully transferred into your account, I intend to use my own share in acquiring some estates abroad. For this too you shall also be the overseas manager of all our properties and you will be paid based on a certain percentage agreed on by both parties. I guarantee you that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Please get in touch with me urgently by E-mail:mr2001@faithmail.com.

phishing,legitimate,True,"BUSINESS DEAL(URGENT). FROM THE DESK OF:MR.BRIAN CAPON NATIONAL WESTMINISTER BANK, LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM.  Dear Friend,  I am Mr.Brian Capon the system and control director at the NATIONAL WESTMINISTER BANK.I am writing this letter to solicit for support and assistance from you to carry out this business opportunity in my bank.  Lying in an inactive account is the sum of 11million pounds sterling belonging to a foreign customer(Michael Gambone) who was a gas consultant here in UK,who happens to be deceased during a business trip. He died with his wife(Deborah Gambone) on board the Swissair Flight 111 , which crashed into the Atlantic off Nova Scotia in september 2nd 1998. The news of this crash was on the news which we have notified his relatives to no avail.See links below for more detail information:  http://cnnstudentnews.cnn.com/WORLD/9809/swissair.victims.list/ http://cnnstudentnews.cnn.com/WORLD/americas/9809/08/swissair.02/  Ever since he died the bank has been expecting his next of kin to come and claim these fund. To this effect, we can not release the money unless someone applies for it as next of kin, as indicated in our banking guideline.Unfortunately he has no family member in UK or Over-sea who are aware of the existence of the money(as he was a gas consultant. At this juncture i have decided to do business with you by soliciting your assistance in applying as the next of kin to the bank then the money will be released to you,as I do not want this money to go into the bank treasury as an unclaimed bill,because the banking law and guideline stipulates that if such money(s) remains unclaimed  for a period of up to nine years(9yrs),the money will be transferred into the bank treasury as an unclaimed bill. My request for a foreigner as next of kin is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a British cannot stand as next of kin.  50% of the money will be your share as a foreign partner and your assistance to actualise this business,thereafter i will visit your country with your help once the money hits your account for disbursement according to the percentage indicated. To effect the immediate transfer of the fund to you as agreed,you must apply first to the bank as the next of kin to the deceased,then we will follow up all formalities for the transaction.  Upon receipt of your reply, i will send to you, the text of the application you are to send to the bank,and further clearify you in other issues as to effect this business. Awaiting to hear from you urgently.  Best Regards Mr.Brian Capon.",1

phishing,legitimate,True,"Urgent Business Proposal Kenya Commercial Bank City Centre,  P.O. Box 44252,Nairobi. Kenya  Email:dan@danielm.org   Dear Sir/Madam,   May I crave your indulgence to open this business discussion with you by an informal letter of this sort. It  is pertinent that a business of this magnitude should have commenced properly with a formal meeting  between you and us to enable both parties know ourselves, have a fore knowledge of the nature of the  business, discuss and acquaint ourselves with the responsibilities and functions of both parties and  appropriate shares accordingly.  I am Dan Wilson Branch Manager of Kenya Commercial Bank in Kenya.This is an urgent and very  confidential business proposition.   On June 6, 2001,a Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the Kenya Ministry Of Energy,  Mr.Clifford Stone made a numbered time(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at  US$21,500,000.00,(Twenty-One Million, five hundred thousand Dollars) in my branch.  Upon maturity,I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month,we  sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers,the National Petroleum  Corporation that Mr.Clifford Stone died from an automobile accident.   On further investigation,I found out that he died without making a WILL,and all attempts to trace his next  of kin was fruitless.   I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.Clifford Stone did not declare any kin or  relations in all his official documents,including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of  US$21,500,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward  to claim it. According to South African Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the  ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.   Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money  which was fixed deposited in my bank. I am writing you because I as a public servant,i cannot operate a  foreign account.   I want to present you as the owner of the funds so you can be able to claim them with the help of my  attorney. This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately your telephone number,full names and  address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the  beneficiary of the funds.   The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 80% for me and 20% for you.The paperwork  for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantees the successful execution of this  transaction.   If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email and Upon your response,I shall then provide  you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.   Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable  for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country.   Due to the nature of confidentiality in this Transaction our communication can only be via email and fax  mostly.   Awaiting your urgent reply via my private email:   Thanks and my regards.

phishing,legitimate,True,"URGENT ASSISTANCE PARAMOUNT SECURITY COMPANY HOLLAND, LAGOS BRANCH. Private Email:{femimartins876@fsmail.net  Dear Friend, I am Mr.femimartins,Manager of paramount security company, Lagos Branch. I apologize for using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that your enviable credentials/particulars were given to me by a member of the South African Export Promotion Council who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as confidential because of the nature of this transaction . I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On Dec. 19, 1998, a Canadian Oil consultant/contractor with the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, Mr. Antoine Blanc made a numbered timed(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty Five Million Dollars)in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Ministry of Energy and Natural resources that Mr. Antoine Blanc died from a plane crash. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a Will, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was futile. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Antoine Blanc did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my security company. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my security company and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 6 (six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as an Foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Antoine Blanc so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.

phishing,legitimate,True,"(Peace) Dear Sir/Madam  At this perceived confusion or stress may have With due respect. Sorry receiving this letter Since we have not known ourselves or met before.  Despite that, I am constrained to write you this letter because of the urgency of it.   By way of self introduction, I am Mrs Joy Afolabi, the wife of late Dr. Sunday Afolabi Little did I know that my Late husband used his position in the present government to influence the  Nigerian government to award SAGEM S.A COMPANY (FRANCE)  the contract of handing the Nigerian national identification card scheme in Nigeria of, which he and his colleagues were then offered the sum of $214 million dollars by SAGEM as bribes.  Since my husband was a care-free person, he was poisoned by his colleagues so that he will not get his share of the deal and later died out of shock during his treatment abroad in Germany when he Finlay realised that his case was as a result of poison, but thank God, my husband was smart enough to have kept some wealth without letting anybody knows about it.   However, since after my husband death, we have suffered maltreatment and untold hardship in the hands of my late husband's family, simply because I did not bear a male child [heir apparent] for my late husband. By tradition, all that my late husband had, [wealth] belongs to his brothers/family. And myself is to be remarried by his immediate younger brother which I vehemently refused. They have taken all that I suffered with my husband to acquire including treasures, houses and his bank particular seized by them. I wanted to escape to the United States of America [USA} with my children on exile, but again they conspired and stole my International passport and  other travelling document to further frustrate me. My three daughters and I are trapped in obnoxious custom and traditional norms.   Thank God, two weeks ago, I received Key Text Code from a Security Company in EUROPE, that my late husband deposited U.S $15.5 Million cash in one Security company in Europe. It has therefore become very necessary and urgent to contact someone a foreigner like you to help me receive/secure these funds overseas in a  reliable bank Account presumably an empty Bank Account, if available and  to help invest it on our behalf as well, while we find a way of getting out to meet with you in your country. These funds are kept with one Security Company in EUROPE to avoid detection, seizure or diversion.   I have had several communication with  the Director of the security company in Europe, who has express willingness to help me on meeting the company's demands.  This is why I have contacted you to help save my children and I By receiving these funds on our behalf. But you need to give me Sufficient assurance that you will not divert the fund if you help me.    My children and I have resolved to give you 30% of the total sum. This is all my children and I have got to live on.    Please, I have reposed my confidence in you and hope you will not disappoint me. I look forward to your urgent response, including your phone/ mobile No and also your fax no for easier communication. The secret codes (e.g Pin No, Secret Access Code)for this fund are safely kept with me which I can give you as soon as you express desire to help me.  Thank in advance for confidentiality and I look forward to hearing from you.  Mrs. Joy Afolabi.

phishing,legitimate,True,"I AM HAPPY TO HAVE YOU AS FRIEND..... My dear.  greetings from miss Fatoumata Saleeby.  I am writting this letter with due respect and heartful of tears since we have not known or met ourselves previously, I am asking for whom to love and love me as well after I have gone through your profile and i just pick interest on you.   I am fair in complexion, I am about 5fit 7in tall, I love sport events, going outdoors activities, watching of moving, shopping, walking etc.In a nutshell, My name is Miss Fatoumata Saleeby 22 years old from the republic of Liberia in west Africa, now seeking for refugee in Dakar-Senegal under the (UNHCR).  I therefore write to inform you that I am the only surviving child and daughter of the deceased Dr. ELIE E. SALEEBY the former MINISTER OF FINANCE / EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CENTRAL BANK OF LIBERIA in the year July 1997-Feb. 2003.  The reason for this correspondence is to formally request for mutual assistance on business relationship with you in order to benefit from your wealth of experience in business.   The secret fact therefore, is that my father kept the sum of US$4,700, 000.00 (Four million seven hundred thousand US Dollars) CASH. The money was deposited at Bank here in Dakar Senegal.   The money is the share of proceeds from a deal executed with my father's colleagues in the hierarchy of membership of the LIBERIAN JOINT PUBLIC TENDER BOARD during a contract award to an Ukrainian - RUSSIA Diamond Extracting Company when my father was a chairman.   Due to the civil war caused by rebel leader Charles Taylor who has just been toppled by another rebel group and my father's status as a civil-servant by law in my country and the sensitivity of my father's position that attracts public attention, he cannot operate a Domiciliary account in order to keep this large sum of money in a bank in my country.   My father retired and died lately before he could withdraw this money here in and transfer it out of Africa. I anticipate to conclude arrangement to start this venture with you as quick as possible.   Due to my youthful age and also refugee here in senegal, decide to claim the money now with a foreign partner.   Upon your indicated interest, we will arrange for a meeting in the country of your choice when the money is moved from the Bank to your account and discuss in details the terms of agreement. I want to invest in any company that you suggest under your professional guidance. Please include your private mobile telephone number in your reply for easy communication.   I earnestly await your urgent response as I expect you to treat this matter with required maturity, attention and committment.   with best regards  Fatoumata Saleeby. v",1

This blew me away: in Barack's victory in Virginia last night, he won 142,000  more votes than all of the Republicans combined, and his victory margin over  Senator Clinton was larger than John McCain's entire vote total. All of this,  in what the Old Guard liked to pretend was ""red state"" Virginia.  When Barack and I rode together in the motorcade in Charleston, South Carolina  on the day I gave him my endorsement, we talked about the three-million-member- strong johnkerry.com community. We both agreed that this email list was a  community of supporters, not an ATM machine.  And so these last weeks, as I've talked with you, as Barack introduced himself  to you, as Ted Kennedy talked about Barack's commitment to health care for all,  and Gov. Tim Kaine talked about Barack's ability to unite our country -- we  haven't asked you to dig into your pockets.  We've asked you to get to know  Barack, to study his positions, to make phone calls to your neighbors, to go  door to door -- to get involved.  But today, I ask you to consider making a contribution as the campaign enters a  new phase. Wisconsin, Texas, Ohio, Pennsylvania -- the next big contests in  this campaign are big media market states, huge states that are expensive to  build statewide field organizations in, and Barack has a lot of ground to make  up. To win, Barack can use all of our help.  Click here to donate what you can: http://click.email.johnkerry.com/?ju=fe6216757361027d7511&ls=fdf715747c670c7977157370&m=fefd1273716607&l=fecd177070660c7d&s=fe2f167176660674721171&jb=ffcf14&t=    So there it is. I know not everyone here is an Obama supporter, and diversity  of opinion is a strength, not a weakness of our community -- but you've ""had my  back"" in so many fights these last years, I knew I could ask you to consider  signing up for another mission.  I have to tell you, this campaign has me excited. Excited, because I have seen  so much hope out there as I've traveled the country for Barack. Excited,  because as frustrated as I've been that the three words ""George W. Bush""  silenced any conversation at dinner tables around the country the last  eight years, I think we've found three words that will open a conversation  across the old divides, regardless of race, religion, gender, or income level -- and those three words are ""President Barack Obama"".  So please, click here to contribute what you can for Barack's campaign: http://click.email.johnkerry.com/?ju=fe6216757361027d7511&ls=fdf715747c670c7977157370&m=fefd1273716607&l=fecd177070660c7d&s=fe2f167176660674721171&jb=ffcf14&t=   I care about making this happen. I care about seeing Barack Obama win against  John McCain in a way that will break the Republican Roadblock in the Senate and  grow our progressive majority in the Congress.  Please dig deep -- I know we can do this.   This feels like the moment that got me and my generation to care about  politics -- and I want it to be the moment that millions more start to care for  the first time, or to care again, the way that you and I do now.

The paper is available on the Publications page of my website, www.EHirst.com << File: http://www.ehirst.com/ >> . Please let me know if you have any comments on the paper. Here is a summary of the paper:         California was supposed to show the rest of the nation a brighter electricity future. That future, as outlined by the California Public Utilities Commission in 1994, envisioned an electricity industry featuring competitive markets. Such markets were intended to produce lower costs and more choices for consumers, while ensuring profits for efficient energy suppliers and encouraging the retirement of old, inefficient power plants.         Although the first two years of restructuring (beginning in April 1998) seemed to bear out these promises, the last year has been a disaster for California's electricity consumers, taxpayers, and electric utilities. Part of the fallout from California's electricity crisis is considerable concern-even opposition-in other states to restructuring the electricity industry.          Although a few states have decided, based on the California experience, not to restructure, I believe that is the wrong outcome. Instead, the primary lessons other states should learn from California are that competitive markets can work; competition is not to blame for California's problems; and basic economic principles of supply, demand, and prices affect market outcomes.         Section 2 of this paper briefly reviews the history of electricity regulation and restructuring in California and the problems that occurred beginning in May 2000. Section 3, the heart of this paper, offers guidance to other states on the key ingredients of a competitive electricity industry. This section makes several points:   Maintain a favorable investment and regulatory climate for new generation to ensure that enough generation capacity is online and planned to meet growing loads.   Ensure that enough infrastructure (transmission capacity and natural gas pipeline capacity) is in place and planned to meet growing loads, maintain reliability, connect new generators to the grid, support large regional markets, and provide fuel to power plants.   Encourage retail customers to participate in dynamic-pricing and voluntary-load-reduction programs (i.e., couple retail and wholesale markets).   Create honest retail competition: avoid standard-offer rates with artificial discounts and create conditions that encourage many companies to offer retail services without favoring individual competitors.   Encourage electricity suppliers to manage and diversify their supply and price risks.   Create efficient and integrated wholesale markets for energy, ancillary services, and transmission congestion.   Monitor and minimize horizontal market power (generation) and vertical market power (combined ownership and operation of generation and transmission).           Ultimately, competitive markets for electricity will lower costs and prices, better align consumer prices with producer costs, improve producer efficiency in both investment and operation, maintain or improve reliability, and yield greater innovation in customer services and pricing options.          But, this transition from one industry structure to another is turning out to be long and complicated. It is complicated because electricity is so important to our modern, high-tech society; electricity is our most flexible fuel, providing light, heat, motive power, and the energy to operate all our electronic equipment. Also, electricity truly is a real-time product for which production and consumption must occur at the same time.          Although the problems that have occurred in California are substantial and worrisome, regulators and legislators in other states should focus on the long-term benefits of competitive electricity markets and accept the possible short-term problems that may occur. They also need to recognize that wholesale markets are regional in scope and extend far beyond the boundaries of any single state. Finally, competition in retail and wholesale markets must be coordinated; in particular, it is not possible to have competitive wholesale markets unless at least some retail load faces time varying prices.          If states restructure properly to create competitive markets for wholesale energy and retail services, we should all benefit. Consumers will enjoy lower prices, they will have many more choices of energy services and price-risk tradeoffs, reliability will be improved because most reliability services will be obtained through markets instead of by engineering edict, and the financial risks associated with building and operating power plants will be assigned properly to investors rather than consumers.

Included in the payment to AEP is a deduction for the sale of the Centana storage gas.  We are selling them 1,236,286 MMBTU @ $2.375 for a total of $2,936,179.25.  The sale is for September, 2001 production.  We will need a deal put in Sitara for that sale along with the appropriate pathing from storage by logistics.  However, there is only 1,195,754 MMBTU on report 006 in Unify (for contracts 96018371, 96014189, and 96019236).  How do we account for this volumetic difference?  Connie will be truing up the GL to match the current Unify volume.  The GL was short approx. 18,000 MMBTU because a beginning balance was not booked.    This needs to happen before the upcoming close.  Thanks for you help in this matter.  Please let me know of any concerns.",0

I would appreciate comments from anyone, pro or > con, with knowledge and experience of these things, however, as I'm rather > limited on both.  I agree - it's never a good idea to use the same data for creating your classifier and determining it's effectiveness (I meant to say ""pick the one with the lowest error rate on your TEST data"").  The reason to choose from many random starts is that fitting a given neural network _model_ (ie. input x, n nodes, ...) is very hard due to the large overparameterisation of the problem space.  For example, the parameters for one node in a given layer can be exchanged with the parameters of another node (as well as the parameters that use those nodes in next layer), without changing the overall model.  This makes it very hard to optimise, and nnet in R often gets stuck in local minima. Looking at what individual nodes are doing, you often see examples where some nodes contribute nothing to the overall classification. The random starts aren't to find different models but to find the parameters for the given model that fits best.  And following this line of argument, you would probably want to use the internal criterion value, rather than some external measure of accuracy.  > The simple answer to the question of obtaining the error rate using > validation data is: Do whatever you like to choose/fit a classifier on the > training set. **Once you are done,** the estimate of your error rate is the > error rate you get on applying that classifier to the validation set.

You need yet new validation data for that.  Understanding that that estimate is biased is important, but in practice, do people really care that much?  If you have looked at a single plot of your data and used that to inform your choice of the classifier your estimates will already be biased (but if you have used other knowledge of the data or subject area, you might expect them to be biased in a positive direction). Are the estimates of model really the most important thing?  Surely an understanding of the problem/data is what you are really trying to gain.

My Dear Friend,  Compliments of the day.I did like to send to you the best wishes of good  health and success in your pursuits particularly through my proposal as  contained in this letter. After due deliberation with my son,I decided to  forward to you this business proposal, we want you to assist us .I will give  you more information. As to this regard as soon as you reply.  I am Mrs.Estelle Mamadou . I am contacting you with the hope that you will  be of great assistance to me, I currently have within my reach the sum of  7.3 million U.S dollars cash which I intend to use for investment purposes.  I therefore personally appeal to you seriously and religiously for your  urgent assistance to move this money in to your country where I believe it  will be safe since I cannot leave the country due to the restriction of  movement imposed on the members of my family by the Senegal Government.  This money came as a result of a payback contract deal between my husband  and a Russian firm in our country.The Russian partners returned my husbands  share .Presently, the Government has intensified their probe in to my  husbands financial resources which has led to the freezing of all our  accounts, local and foreign, the revoking of all our business licences and  the arrest of my First son.  In view of this I want to acted very fast to withdraw this money from one of  our finance houses before it will be closed down.My husband deposited the  money in a finance firm for safe keeping . No record is known about this  fund by the government because there is no documentation showing that we  have such funds.  Further more, my elder son have been in detention in the last four years  following the death of my late husband for charges of State organized murder  and corrupt practices. he was just been released by the Supreme Court after  the president brokered a deal with my family regarding his freedom. and he  is still under interrogation about my late husband's assets and some vital  documents.  Due to the current situation in the country and government attitude to my  family,I cannot make use of this money within, thus I seek your help in  transferring this funds out for investment than leaving the fund here and to  invest the money to profit my family Bearing in mind that you may assist  me.l have decided to part with 25% of the total sum.  I am seriously considering to settle down abroad in a friendly atmosphere  like yours as soon as this fund get into your account so that I can start  all over again if only you wish. I shall ask my son Mohammade to come over  to your country to liaise with you. If this proposal satisfies you. please  do not let me out to the security as I am giving you this information in  total trust and confidence.  Please kindly reply by return mail and please include your personal  telephone and fax numbers. Conclusively,we have decided part with 25% of the  total sum. of the total sum,10% will be for expenses incurred during  thecause of this transaction, while 65% is to be held on trust by you until  we can decide on a suitable business investment in your country subsequent  to our free movement by the Senegal Government.  I will greatly appreciate if you accept my proposal in good faith. Your URGENT response is needed.  Regards and God Bless you.

phishing,legitimate,True,"please, can you help me in this time of need?         Dearest one,        Grace and peace be multiplied unto you.   I know my mail might be a surprise to you but never mind because I am contacting you in good faith. There are certain times in ones life that whether or not one indicates interest for certain assignment, people would look up to him/her for assistance.        I'm Miss Naomi stephane, a 23year old ophan from the Republic of Zimbabwe.        During the current crisis against the farmers of Zimbabwe by the supporters of President Robert Mugabe to claim all the white owned farms in our country, he ordered all the white farmers to surrender their farms to his party members and their followers. My father however was one of the best farmers in the country, hence the supporters invaded my father's farm and burnt down everything, killed him and confiscated his properties (i've earlier lost my mom in my teen). So, after the tragic incident i decided to relocate to Cote d'ivoire (where dad told me he has money saved in a reserve company) for safety.        Before dad actually gave up in the hospital, he told me that  he deposited the sum of $5,200,000,( five million two hundred thousand dollars) in a private security(reserve) company as family valuable property in a trunk box for safekeeping of the fund.    He also gave me the documents which was given to him when the money was deposited.      The following are the documents:  (i)Certificate of deposit                   (ii)Agreement of deposit          (iii)Receipt of deposit payment.          Dad told me while on his dying bed to tranfer the money abroad in an enabling enviroment and use it for profitable adventures.         Please, I want you to know also that this money is the only hope we have for our future survival as our greedy relative made do with whatever remains of the party supporters loot except this fund which they're not aware of.            However, at present there's political uprising in the country where we are and the Northern Region has been seized by a separatist rebelious group that are also causing disturbanses in the commecial capital where i live at present.        My purpose of contacting you is for you to help me retrieve the fund and provide a bank account abroad (in your place) where i will transfer my inheritted fund and assist me to come over to your place and use it for profitable ventures in partnership with you.  Though you will be the initial manager since i'm more interested in completing my education which has been interrupted by my fathers demise.         Based on the experience i suppose you possess living in a developed economy, I believe with that esteem knowledge in the business world my money will be properly channeled in a viable/profitable business venture.            I am willing to offer you 20% of the total sum if you will assist me in good faith.     'Looking forward to hearing frm you                                         Best regards,                                         Miss Naomi           --------------------------------- Scopri la community di Yahoo!

My husband severed in the ZANU PF Government lead by Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe.   He operated in Mozambique, Angola, and Congo formerly Zaire lead by Mubutu Seseseko, during this period He was used as a confidante's by Robert Mugabe and his hierarchy to carry out their shady deals of smuggling Diamonds and gold from mines which were situated in areas controlled by Zimbabwean soldiers.   During this period he managed to accumulate a personal fortune of US$10,000,000 (TEN Million United States Dollars) which he secretly Lodged with a security and finance company here in South Africa as 'precious Stones"" because of the fear of my country president Robert Mugabe   Before the 2002 presidential election in Zimbabwe my husband defected to the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) because he defied an order to send a contingent of his battalion to go and attack innocent white farmers for refusing to give up their land, as a result of that and because of the position my husband held and the secret duties that he executed for ZANU PF he was put under surveillance by the central intelligence organisation and Mugabe's secret police. He was caught and thrown into the prison and later he was killed by Robert Mugabe and is partners Before his death, he managed to smuggle out a letter to me intimating me about the existence of the sum, which he deposited with the security and finance company in South Africa, which he acquired during his operations for president Robert Mugabe and ZANU PF Because of the strong relationship existing between the current South Africa Government and Zimbabwean Government it is increasingly becoming too risky for me and my Son to remain in South Africa.

I have heavy issues with HOTMAIL since they reject ANY legitim messages as SPAM without any reason.  All of my 50 Servers are worldwide and in different subnets.  It is nearly impossible that all 50 Servers have spamed HOTMAIL, since my servers accept only authenticated SMTP from clients.

My main purpose of sending you this mail is because of the way I found  you and perhaps trustworthy to give you this priority of shipping the  trunk box to any address that you think is very secure and save in your  country for onward lodgement in your account for the purpose of future  investment with your percentage of which we shall talk of it. I will  send you the Authorization Certificate to call them in my next mail  which is the Certificate of deposit that they gave me on the very day  when the box of money was deposited under their security company.

phishing,legitimate,True,"URGENT REPLY PLEASE. Dear Friend,  Attention Please.   Sorry to disturb you. I am Dr Idris Ali, the Director in charge of Auditing  and Accounting section of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B) Ouagadougou  Burkina-faso West Africa. With due respect and regard. I have decided to  contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both  of us at the end of the transaction .   During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came  across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a  plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank  without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or  relation before our discovery to this development.   The said amount was U.S 7.5M (Seven Million,Five Hundred Thousand United  States Dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive  information through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole arrangement  to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get  the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been  put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as  soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist, and also  benefit your self to this great business opportunity.   In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this  country as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign  account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of  transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will  require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin  with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign  account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his  request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the  correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from  to your own designation bank account.   I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On  smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the  total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of  expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and  internet bills, while 60% will be for me and my coleagues. Please, you have  been adviced to keep ""Top Secret"" as I am still in service and intend to  retire from service after we conclude this deal with you.   I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm  the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for  subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated  and further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us  to invest in. All other necessary vital nformation will be sent to you when  I hear from you.   I look forward to receive your phone and fax numbers for easy communication,   Yours faithfully,   Dr Idris Ali.  _________________________________________________________________ Windows Live Messenger : venez tester la version bta !  http://www.ideas.live.com/programpage.aspx?versionId=5d21c51a-b161-4314-9b0e-4911fb2b2e6d",1

legitimate,phishing,True,"RE: Redfield Deliverability Project I would appear to me that there may be some misconceptions here.     Why do we assume that by entering into a financing deal we will be any better off?  I would tell you that to the extent there was any risk in the deal, that we should probably charge someone else about 25-30% as well.     Think about it, 25% is only 15% after tax.   Has some one enumerated the risks and valued them on this deal?   I haven't seen any of that work, if it has been done.           I think I understand the concept proposed and I understand the proposed goal line, return with little or no expense up front.     I would assume that we would be willing to enter into a fixed price service agreement for a number of years?     Is Halliburton willing to take any risks whatsoever?  Alternatively, why don't we go through GSS (Global Strategic Sourcing) to look for a better deal?	  Jim:   Have you looked at this for ideas on the accounting side?    Why can't I do a prepayment of a service contract fee and recognize the expense over the life of the deal?   -----Original Message----- From: 	Waymire, Dave   Sent:	Wednesday, October 17, 2001 9:17 AM To:	Hayslett, Rod; Gilbert, Steve Cc:	Centilli, James Subject:	RE: Redfield Deliverability Project  Rod,  Below is some background on the Redfield Deliverability Project.  Halliburton initiated the contact with NNG to provide work over on selected wells based on software modeling in order to return deliverability to their original levels.  The work overs are planned over a 2-3 year period and are expected to have a lasting effect of at least 10 years.  The cost to model and rework these wells is estimated to be $5.73MM.  A test program would be conducted in the first year to determine the feasibility of continuing the program at a cost of $768,000.  If the test program did not prove out the project would be terminated at this point.  The original proposal was to treat the costs of the program as expense as the costs were incurred. Bob Chandler confirmed this accounting treatment.  This would result as Kent has indicated negative EBIT for the first 2-3 years.   As an alternative it was proposed to Halliburton that NNG would enter into a 10 year service agreement with Halliburton to model and rework the wells and provide guidance on proposed well work overs for the Redfield storage field.  Halliburton would agree to perform the test program and if test results indicate that further work overs would be economically feasible would spend an additional $4.96MM on a total of 60 well workovers in the first 3 years of the contract.  NNG currently budgets $300,000 per year for Redfield well maintenance with minimal increase in deliverability. Operations has committed $300,000 per year in well maintenance over the next 5 years to this project for a total of $1.5MM.  Halliburton has not formalized their counter offer, but has indicated that they would require a 25% to 30% return for assuming the financing.  Halliburton indicated that this is a non-standard deal for them and that is the reason for high return requirement.    The objective is to structure the deal as a service agreement either with an Enron Entity who would then contract with Halliburton or some other third party at a more reasonable rate.  Even at an estimated 30% return, preliminary incremental EBIT estimates for the Halliburton service agreement are between $400,000 to $500,000 the first 5 years and  $250,00 to $275,000 for the out years.       -----Original Message----- From: 	Hayslett, Rod   Sent:	Friday, October 12, 2001 7:05 AM To:	Gilbert, Steve Cc:	Waymire, Dave Subject:	RE: Redfield Deliverability Project  Couple of quick comments.    Prepaying as an expense would require coming up with some income to offset, and generally doesn't make economic sense.   An Enron company can't help because it consolidates, and therefore ends up with the same accounting results as we do.       What accountants have reviewed the proposal?   -----Original Message----- From: 	Miller, Kent   Sent:	Thursday, October 11, 2001 9:52 AM To:	Hayslett, Rod; McCarty, Danny Cc:	Waymire, Dave; Neubauer, Dave; Neville, Sue; Thomas, Steve Subject:	Redfield Deliverability Project  Rod,  We looking for your help on some ideas on how to implement a good long term project that has negative short term cash flow.  We have been working with Halliburton to identify deliverability improvements at Redfield through the use of  improved technology related to identifying poor performing wells and implementing down hole remediation.  This project has costs and revenues as shown below that are great from a long term standpoint.  Steve Thomas and Maurice Gilbert have done an excellent job of identifying the benefits to NNG and the upsides in revenue that are expected.  Dave Waymire has also been very helpful in analyzing alternative and economics and have shown that the project has a great return (in excess of 30%).  Our problem is that the cost for the workovers at Redfield are all O&M expenses and not capital and we have a negative IBIT for the first 2 - 3 years of the project.  We have proposed that Halliburton structure the expenses such that they come in over a 5 - 10 year period so we don't have this negative IBIT flow in the first years, however, Halliburton has not been interested and has proposed a 30% finance charge for this structure.  What would be the appetite for possibly pre-paying a majority of these costs in '01 to avoid the negative '02 and '03 earnings impact or is there an Enron company that would finance/extend the expense payments.  This is a great project that we should do, however, it is difficult given the negative earnings impacts in the first couple of years.  Got any ideas to handle this financial hurdle??????

No other person knows  about this account or any thing concerning it, the account has no other  beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that this company does  not know anything about this account and the amount involved is (USD 45M) Forty  Five million United States Dollars).

phishing,legitimate,True,"Co-Operation FROM MR. JAMES OPOKU TEL: +233 208216645  Before I introduce myself, I wish to inform you that this letter is not  a hoax mail and I urge you to treat it serious. This letter must come  to you as a big surprise, but I believe it is only a day that people  meet and become great friends and business partners.  My name is Mr. James Opoku, the present branch Manager of a bank here  in Ghana. I write you this proposal in good faith, believing that I can  trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you. Like I  said, I have a transaction that will benefit both of us, as your  assistance is required as a foreigner. I use to head the Accounts  department in my bank head office, but last December I was asked to  take position of a Manager of our branch in Kumasi who passed on, so  that was how I became the present Manager and discovered a fortune. As  I resumed duty, I discovered an account with total sum of $12,500,000  million that has not been operated on for the past 4 years. From my  investigation, I found out that this account belongs to one Late Mr.  Morris Thompson an American great industrialist and a resident of  Alaska, who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of Alaska  Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31 2000, including his  wife and only daughter.  You shall read more news about the crash on visiting this site which I  got during my investigation;    and //www.nativefederation.org/history/people/mThompson.html  The account is escrow call account, a secret type of account in my bank  and no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning  it, the account has no other beneficiary. I have kept a close  monitoring of the account since then and nobody has come forward to ask  about the money as next of kin to the late Mr. Morris Thompson, meaning  that no one is aware of the account.  I cannot directly take out this money without the help of a foreigner  and that is why I am contacting you for an assistance to claim the  funds and share it with me. As the Manager of my bank branch, I have  the power to influence the release of the funds to any foreigner that  comes up as the next of kin to the account, with the correct  information concerning the account, which I shall give you.  I am seeking your co-operation to present you as the next of kin to the  account, so that my bank head quarters will release the funds to you.  There is practically no risk involved, the transaction will be executed  under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of  law.  If you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to  share the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied.  Contact me as soon as you receive this message if you feel we can work  together, so we can go over the details.  Thanking you in advance and may God bless you.  Please, treat with utmost confidentiality. I wait your urgent response.  You can as well contact me by phone the number is +233208216645.  Regards,  Mr. James Opoku.",1

phishing,legitimate,True,"business Dear Sir/Madam,  I am contacting you on a transfer of a huge sum. of money from a deseased. Though I know that a  transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day.  Introduction:  My name is Mr. Keykhosrow Sobhe and l am the Solicitor to Mr. Robert who died on a plane crash with his entire family on the 11th of September 2001 along side other passengers in flight 175. from Boston, Massachusetts to Los Angeles California, it was the second hijacked plane to strike the World. Trade Center plugging into the South Tower. Two pilots and seven flight attendants and fifty-seven(57) passengers were on board.  Since Mr. Roberts death, there has not been any application to claim his money by a next-of-kin as his wife who was supposed to be his next-of-kin died along side with my late client in the same accident. After 4 years of dormancy any such accounts holding funds of certain magnitudes will be re-directed to the bank treasury as unclaimed funds  and will be shared among the bank share holders. After which the file will  be closed. This is what I am trying to prevent from happening. I will rather see the whole money go directly to charity organization with a help of a foreigner.  If you share the same ideology as myself, please do not hesitate to contact me. However, it may interest you to know that we have secured from probate  and order of mandamus to locate any of the diseased surviving next-of-kin. upon this discovery. I now seek your permission to have you stand as a next-of-kin to the deceased.  All documentation will be carefully worked out by me for the funds to be released into your favor as the beneficiary's next-of-kin.  NOTE: THE REASON WHY I AM DOING THIS IS THAT, I WOULD RATHER SEE THE WHOLE AMOUNT GO DIRECTLY TO CHARITY, THAN HAVE THOSE BANK DIRECTORS AND SHARE HOLDERS HAVE IT IN THEIR PERSONAL BANK ACCOUNTS.  IT IS ALSO A LIFE TIME OPPORTUNITY FOR ME AND HOPEFULLY YOU AS WELL.

legitimate,phishing,True,"Re: VmWare -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA1  Thanks, both what you and Alex said is very clear. I assume that once you hit ctrl+g to interact with the vm, you can use normal speakup review keys, and get speech from a serial hardware synth, assuming you correctly redirected the virtual serial port to the machine's physical serial port? Did you use ssh to do the install, because interacting with the vm isn't as simple as I assumed in my previous question, or was it simply because you just wanted to use ssh to do the install, or because you didn't have a physical serial port/hardware synth? Has anyone tried running gnome in a vmware machine running on a windows host? If this is all as straight forward as it sounds, and as good as it sounds, I may not have to worry about gnu/linux compatible hardware, (I.E. modem, wireless card, on-board serial ports, ETC.), and about the warranty if you resize partitions or remove windows, when looking for a new laptop in the future.

Investment Highlights:  BMXG is exceptionally we|| positioned at the forefront of one of the  most exciting new frontiers in biotech- stem cel| research.  Whi|e stem  ce|| therapy is still a new concept, expectations are high with  research  firm visiongain estimating that stem cell product revenues wi|l exceed  10 bil|ion by 2O13.  Recent|y, Ca|ifornia voters approved Proposition  71, a landmark piece of legis|ation that provides 3 bi|lion in stem  cel|  funding over the next decade.  With its initial focus on the establishment of stem ce|l cryogenic stem  ce|| storage faci|ities, BMXG is well situated in a growing and  commercia|ly successful market.  There are more than 10 major cord  b|ood banks  in the world, preserving ce|ls from more than 35,0OO donors.  Viacel|  has estimated that this market is 1.2 billion in the US and over 2  bi||ion wor|dwide.  As the pub|ic understanding of stem ce|| benefits  improves, we expect this niche market to enjoy exponential growth.  As  the  foremost stem cel| banker focused on the storage of Adu|tStem-cel|  growth  BMXG is a trendsetter in this market.  BMXG is making aggressive entry into the stem cell instrumentation  market with deve|opment of new medical devices specifical|y designed to  facilitate the removal and transp|ant of stem ce||s.  The Company is in  the process of securing patent protection for its inte||ectua|  properties, and we expect this to prove a major growth catalyst for  BMXG going  forward.  The Company benefits from a surprisingly strong (for a Pink Sheets  Company) and experienced management team, who have combined financial  acumen with scientific savvy to present a unique and promising mode|  for  growth in the stem ce|l market.  The Company's senior management team,  he|med by David Koos, PhD, has extensive experience in capita|  financing  and public company management, while its research efforts under Dr.  Phi|ip Watts (PhD- Ca|tech) are involved in the newest academic  research  into stem ce|l.   Investment Conclusion: Projected Va|uation: 3.5O per share  Wa|l Street has been quick to the react to the potential of stem cel|  research and stem cell stocks are outperforming a|l of the major  biotech  indices.  Leading stem cel| research companies such as StemCe|ls, Inc.  (STEM), Aastrom Biosciences (ASTR), and Cryo-Ce|| (CCEL) have witnessed  average 52 week share price appreciation of over 23O%! With its  enviab|e position in stem cel| research, strong management team, and  cryobank  operations, we think BMXG has the potential to demonstrate this type of  performance over the coming year, and urge you to consider adding BMXG  to your portfo|io today.

phishing,legitimate,True,"CAN I TRUST YOU ON THIS   Dear Sir/Madam Compliment of the day to you . I got your contact through business search from the internet. I am Mr.Mustapha Momodu, Account Manager of Standard Chartered Bank Kanashie Branch . I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On December 29th 2002, an American contractor with the Government of Ghana, Mr. Michael Creek made a numbered time (Fixed) deposited for twelve calendar months, valued at TWENTY TWO Million,Four hundred thousand dollars ($22.4million) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, that Mr. Michael Creek died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he did not leave a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Michael Creek did not declare any next of kin in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork. This sum of $22.4million is still sitting in Standard Chartered Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.  No one will come forward to claim it. According to the laws of the country, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to assist me fully as foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Michael creek,  so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide me immediately with your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavites, which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of two attorneys for drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 30% for you while 10% will be set aside for miscellaneous expenses. There is no risk involved in this transaction, as every necessary paperwork for this fund, will be done and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. Hope this mail will meet your perfect understanding. Best Regards. Mr.Mustapha Momodu  P/S:You can contact me also via my private email at mr_mustapha_stb@yahoo.com",1

I am the personal attorney to Late. Mr. Kenneth Berg a foreign national, who used to work as a contractor with Crystal Construction Company in Abidjan,Cote D`Ivore.   On the 21st of April 2000, my client, his wife and their three children were involved in a car accident along the auto route and all occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives. Since then I have made several enquiries both local and international to locate any of my clients relatives which has proved largely unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts to locate any member of his family for the past three years I decided to contact you.  I am contacting you to assist in transferring out the money left behind by my client to your country before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the bank where this huge deposit were lodged. Particularly the bank where the deceased had an account valued at 10 million United States dollars, they have issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the account confiscated within the next one month.   Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 3years now I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased so that the proceeds of this account valued at 10 million USD can be paid to you and then you and me can share the money 50% to me and 50% to you. I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim we may make like the Certificate of Deposit and Copy of Agreement issued to my client on the date of deposit, I also have a copy of the death Certificate of my client. All I require is your honest cooperation and maximum secrecy to enable us see this deal through.   I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Please get in touch with me through my email address above and repeated here  ( abrahamlegalfirm@rediffmail.com ) and send to me your personal telephone / fax numbers and email address to enable us discuss further about this transaction.

E-MAIL BOX:barrcharleszuma1@yahoo.ca    My name is Mr.JAMES BROWN. I am the credit AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING  UNIT,BANK OF AFRICA,COTONOU-BENIN REPBLIC. I am contacting you of a business   transfer, of a huge sum of money from a deceased account. Though I know  that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and  worried, but I am assuring you that everything has been taken care off,  and all will be well at the end of the day. I decided to contact you  due to the urgency of this transaction.  PROPOSITION; I am the account officer  of a foreigner named Gerald Welsh  who died in an air crash along with his wife on the 31st October 1999  in an Egyptian airline 990 with other passengers on board. You can  confirm this from the website below which was published by BBC WORLD  NEWS.   WEBSITE. http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stm Since his  death, none of his next-of-kin are alive to make claims for this money  as his heir, because they all died in the same accident himself and his  wife(May their soul rest in peace). We cannot release the fund from his  account unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin to the  deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.   Upon this discovery, I now seek your permission to have you stand as a  next of kin to the deceased, as all documentations will be carefully  worked out by me for the funds (USD 10,700,000.00) to be released in  your favor as the beneficiary's next of kin. Because after four years the  money will be called back to the bank treasury as unclaimed bills and  the money shared amongst the directors of the bank.    so it is on this note i decided to seek for whom his name shall be used as the next of kin/beneficiary to this funds rather than allow the bank directors to  share this money amongst themselves at the end of the year.  It may interest you to know that we have secured from the probate an  order of mandamus to locate any of the deceased beneficiaries. Please  acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual  business endeavor by furnishing me with the following information if you are  interested.   1.A Beneficiary name. In order for me to prepare the document for  transfer of the funds in your name. 2. Direct Telephone and fax  numbers. For  our personal contact and mutual trust in each other.  I shall be compensating you with [3million Million Dollars)  on final conclusion of this project for your assistance, while the  balance of 5 Million Dollars shall be for me for investment purposes.  Because I intend to retire after the conclusion of this transaction.  If this proposal is acceptable by you, please endeavor to contact me  immediately. Do not take undue advantage of the trust I have bestowed  in you, I await your urgent reply. to this address: barrcharleszuma1@yahoo.ca    Regards,  CHARLES ZUMA   - kingnnaji3 nnaji",1

Company Name: Yukon Go|d Corporation, Inc Symbo|: YGDC  Shares Outstanding: Approx. 9.8 mil|ion  Currently trading at: $ 1.00  Major Breaking news!   Yukon Gold Corporation, Inc. Acquires Bil|iOn DO|lar Polymeta|lic  Inground Resource in Canadas Pro|ific Tombstone Go|d Belt, Yukon Territory  Press Release Source: Yukon Gold Corporation, Inc.  Toronto, Canada, March O7, 2005. Yukon Go|d Corporation, Inc. (Yukon  Go|d), (YGDC) announced today that it has acquired the Marg  Deposit, a 20,O0O acre, volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS)  property,  located in the centra| Yukon Territory.  Marg Deposit Mineral Resource Estimate:  Based on a 1997 ore resource study by Franzen Minera| Engineering Ltd.,  the Marg Deposit has a dri|l indicated resource of 6,1OO,0OO tons  grading 1.76% copper, 4.60% zinc, 2.46% lead, 62.7 g. of silver per ton  and  0.98 g. of go|d per ton over an average true width of 6.1 metres (20  ft.). Open a|ong strike in both directions and down dip, the Company  believes this c|assic base meta| deposit has the major potential for  substantia||y increasing tonnage.  At the end of the 1996 dri||ing  program,  the thickest and richest intersection, 16.2 metre (53 ft.) true width  averaged 2.82% copper, 2.46% lead, 5.5O% zinc, 82.5 g of si|ver and  1.84  g. of go|d per ton.  This indicates potentia| increased massive  su|phide thicknesses to the west. Based on current meta| prices, the  in-ground  va|ue of the Marg resource without any further exp|oration is just over  1 Bi||i0n d0|lars. (*)(**) A preliminary evaluation by Yukon Golds  engineers  and geologists have determined this outcropping deposit with its  favorab|e topography, resource base and excel|ent exploration  potentia|, will  warrant proceeding to production.  (*) Dollar Figure in Canadian (**)Tota| in-ground resources and current va|ues based on US Copper   $1.50 lb, Lead  $0.45 lb, Zinc  $0.62 |b, Silver  $7.29 oz., Go|d   $432.OO oz. as  of February 23, 2005, Exchange rate O.8O.

While games programs have been engineered for efficiency from the early days, high-performance planners are a relatively recent development.  Both planning and games are important fields of research in the Artificial Intelligence community. A trend in the computer game community, exemplified in initiatives such as the General Game Playing Project and ORTS, has been on playing whole classes of games, and on increasing realism and complexity. This tests the limits of traditional game-tree search approaches. However, the planning community has a lot of experience in dealing with huge search spaces. Furthermore, such games also involve current topics of much current interest in planning, such as: time reasoning, resource management, imperfect information, cost-based planning, etc.  This workshop will discuss all aspects of using planning in the domain of games. Relevant topics include, but are not limited to:  - planning techniques for classical games - planning in commercial computer games - integration of planning and game tree search - representational issues: languages for planning in games - opportunities for technology transfer between the communities - competitions - planning stories and scenarios - planning and interactive narrative - integrating planning and affective systems - planning for NPCs - dialogue planning - reasoning about actions and game playing - plan recognition - learning plans  Important Dates: ================  Submission Deadline (extended):    June 25, 2007    11:59pm PST (Samoa time UTC-11)  Notifications and Technical Program:    July 13, 2007  Camera-Ready Paper Submissions:    July 31, 2007  Workshop Date:    September 23, 2007  Submission Procedure: =====================  We ask authors to submit technical papers in PDF format. Papers should be formatted in accordance with the AAAI style template and may be at most 8 pages long, including figures and bibliography. Visit the url http://www.aaai.org/Publications/Author/author.php for formatting instructions. Please submit papers via email to ombquvcukfr-kn6862@lab.inf.uc3m.es  Please note that all submitted papers will be carefully peer-reviewed by multiple reviewers, and that low-quality or off-topic papers will not be accepted.

Seven Republicans voted against the proposal, while three Democrats voted in favor. Rep. Johnson (R-Conn.) says the bill, sponsored by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Thomas (R-Calif.), would put $9 billion into state coffers within 10 days of enactment.  The bill would allow states to use the funds to pay regular unemployment benefits, increase benefit payments, extend benefits beyond 26 weeks, expand benefit eligibility, or for administrative purposes. The bill also would extend the work opportunity tax credit and the welfare-to-work tax credit through Dec. 31, 2003, and contains provisions to boost the Social Services Block Grant program by $3 billion so that states can give health coverage to the unemployed. Critics of the bill--including congressional Democrats, labor, and civil rights groups--claim the measure will not accomplish the Republicans' stated goals of stimulating the economy and getting displaced workers back on the job. A substitute measure offered by House Democrats is rejected by a vote of 261-166. Senate Majority Leader Daschle (D-S.D.) tells reporters that he hopes the Senate will be able to pass its own version of an economic stimulus bill before Thanksgiving. . . .

First Unum Life Ins. Co., ""Ark., No. 00-1430, 10/18/01). Reversing summary judgment for First Unum Life Insurance Co., the supreme court holds that because both the insurer and James Elam submitted evidence outside of the insurance policy to support their interpretations of the term ""mental illness,"" the issue is a question of fact for a jury to decide. The policy defines mental illness as ""mental, nervous or emotional diseases or disorders of any type."" Arguing the term is ambiguous, Elam says bipolar affective disorder is a physical illness with a biological origin that is treated with medication. . . . Page A-1 http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/dlr.nsf/id/a0a4w6a7e7_ SIXTH CIRCUIT BLOCKS MOVE TO SEPARATE FLSA, LMRA CLAIMS A former truck driver's attempt to separate claims he brought under the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Labor-Management Relations Act in order to avail himself of the FLSA's two-year statute of limitations falls short, as the Sixth Circuit finds the wage claim barred by the federal labor law's six-month limitations period (""Martin v. Lake County Sewer Co., ""6th Cir., No. 00-00228, 10/17/01). In addition to seeking unpaid wages under the FLSA after his discharge, Donald Martin charged his former employer, Lake County Sewer Co., with violating the terms of its collective bargaining agreement with a Teamsters local in violation of LMRA Section 301. Martin also contended that the union violated its duty of fair representation under Section 301 by failing to pursue a grievance against Lake for allegedly improper deductions in his benefits and pay. Martin argues his FLSA claim is distinct from the Section 301 claim and therefore governed by the wage law's two-year limitations period. According to the Sixth Circuit, however, Martin's charge relating to the unpaid wages was based on the provision in the collective bargaining agreement governing compensation and must be resolved in accordance with LMRA procedures. . . .

Ulster County, ""N.D. N.Y., No. 99-CV-1278, 10/10/01). Rejecting a summary judgment motion by Ulster County Golden Hill Health Care Center, Judge Homer of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York finds that Gail Becker established enough evidence to go to trial on her claims of sexual harassment based on a hostile work environment and retaliation under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and other laws. Her evidence surrounding the assault incident--including her supervisor's failure to allow Becker to call the police and the facility's refusal to allow her time off to seek a protective order--if credited, ""establishes an incident sufficient by itself to support a finding that the conditions of her employment were irrevocably altered as a result and that those conditions became abusive,"" the court holds. . . .

Business activity recovered quickly from some aspects of the attacks, such as reduced air cargo capacity, but long-run effects are more difficult to assess, according to the Fed. New since the attacks, however, are disruptions to productivity due to increased security precautions and insurance premiums, the central bank says. . . .

Your name was referred and recommended in confidence to me by a good friend who assured me of your reliability and trustworthiness because I have been very careful due to the sensitive nature of this transaction notwithstanding the present dishonesty that surrounds the world today.    I am Gen Ibrahim Usman one of the Special Adviser to the past Military Government in this position I was privileged to keep in my custody for the government, the sum of Sixty-eight Million U.S Dollars (US$68, 000,00) only to the knowledge of the head of state.     This money was diverted from the money,. Which Untied Nations released through the Nigeria Government to ECOMOG (Peace Keeping Forces) for its operations in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Suddenly the former head of State died on the 8th June 1998.

phishing,legitimate,True,"how 's it going ? hello friend , my name is carl simmons . in october 1988 , i received this bulletin in the mail . naturally i was skeptical , but i decided to try it because i was heavily in debt at the time . i had everything to gain and nothing to lose . even if this program worked only a fraction of what the example showed , i would be a success ! well , i m adding this note here to tell you it does work ! i will never forget how it happened . i followed the instructions exactly . the total cost was about $ 46 . 00 including postage . i dropped the envelopes off a the post office on my way to work one day in late october hoping to earn a few dollars to buy christmas presents . the recipe i ordered from the person in the # 1 position came in about a week . i did not think much about it after that until a few weeks later when my boss told me my wife had called and i was needed at home immediately due to some emergency . i raced home in a panic , threw the apartment door open , and what a sight i saw ! my wife was standing over a pile of envelopes that the mailman had dumped on the living room floor from two big canvas bags . we spend the rest of the day and most of the night opening and counting 3 , 245 envelopes , each containing $ 2 . 00 and a self-addressed stamped envelope . the next day we received 4 , 274 more . by the time the orders stopped coming in , about two weeks later , i had received $ 92 , 428 . 00 in cash ! ( i wonder what the printer though when i had him print 46 , 000 copies of the recipes in one week ! ) needless to say , i immediately quit my job , paid off al my debts in full and started another mailing . to date my revenues are approaching $ 1 , 000 , 000 . 00 in cold hard cash . believe me , you can do the same thing . this is you lucky break that you have been hoping for all your life . you can make your dreams come true . . . do not pass it up ! the most difficult part was finding a good company to provide responsive names . after trying many name sources , i ran across two companies that provided the best names for this program . their addresses and prices are below : mjg advertising 200 names $ 24 . 00 p . o . box 3009 500 names $ 35 . 00 maple glen , pa 19002 1000 names $ 50 . 00 ( 215 ) 643-1328 2000 names $ 75 . 00 ( 800 ) 880-8143 marnico lists 200 names $ 20 . 00 p . o . box 2046 500 names $ 35 . 00 abington , ma 02351 1000 names $ 60 . 00 request # 3001 2000 names $ 95 . 00 making your fortune is as easy as following these six steps : 1 . send a self addressed stamped envelope and $ 2 . 00 cash wrapped in a sheet of paper specifying which recipe you are ordering by number , to addresses # 1 through # 5 at the end of this bulletin . 2 . order at least 200 names and addresses on labels from the companies mentioned earlier . 3 . while waiting for your labels to arrive , remove the name at the # 1 spot and move each of the names up one position . place your name and address in spot # 5 . move only the names and addresses - not the recipes . this can best be done by retyping the set and pasting the new over the original . 4 . have a local printshop print at least 200 copies of this bulletin . 5 . fold the printed bulletins and place in envelopes , seal and stamp them . 6 . when the labels arrive , place one on each envelope and mail them . now here s the best part - the money you can make ! here is what happens when only 10 % of the people respond to your mailing . you send out at least 200 with your name in position # 5 . 20 people send out at least 200 with your name in position # 4 . 400 people send out at least 200 with your name in position # 3 . 8000 people send out at least 200 with your name in position # 2 . 160000 people send out at least 200 with your name in position # 1 . 168420 x $ 2 . 00 each = $ 336840 in about 60 to 90 days ! ! ! of course you are not limited to mailing only 200 bulletins , or to just one mailing . send out more than 250 or do repeat mailings and you will drastically increase your earnings . when you receive 1 , 000 requests for recipe # 3 , sit back and relax knowing that you re soon going to be a very rich person . yes , this is a perfectly legal mail order marketing plan . if you are in doubt , then refer to title 18 , section 1302 and 1341 of the u . s . postal and lottery laws . a product or service must be exchanged for the money received ; in this case , the product is the recipes . this plan also takes honest work , but the rewards are tremendous . keep a careful account of all money you received and money you spend for income tax purposes . there you have it ! the secret to making thousands for yourself . read this bulletin carefully and then reread it again . think about it , do the math and consider the wealth potential this holds for you . then send $ 2 . 00 cash and a self-addressed stamped envelope today to the addresses in positions # 1 below . go for it , order those recipes today . 1 . chocolate cream pie 2 . pineapple bavarian pudding henry w . frye , sr . harold lookwood 24684 atwood ave . 123 skokorat st . moreno valley , ca 92553 seymour , ct . 06483 3 . chocolate walnut cookies 4 . cheese garlic biscuits vincent myers , jr . dlh enterprises inc . 848 n . rainbow , # 351 p . o . box 5854 las vegas , nv 89107 san jose , ca 95150 5 . magic cookies bar acw enterprises p . o . box 3004-332 corvallis , or 97333 i tried a similar program in which the cost was $ 5 . 00 . in that one , the response was only about 3 % . the first time i sent out this recipe program a got my first responses in just one week . i sent out 250 letters instead of just 100 so my percentage of gains was higher . i am trying again with 500 letters to see if i can surpass the $ 141 , 236 . 00 of the last time . good luck to all of you . it really works ! ! ! sally freisch , st louis , il",1

phishing,legitimate,True,"for assistant Dear Sir, I am Alhaji Mohammed Abacha, the son of the late Nigerian Head of State who died on the 8th of June 1998 while in active services. Following the sudden death of my father, General Sani Abacha, the present Civilian Government has thrown my family and I into a state of utter confusion,  frustration,and hopelessness.  I have been subjected to inhuman physical and physiological torture, incarceration by the security Agents in my country. I was only recently released from detention after been arraigned before the Federal High Court of Nigeria for an offence committed by my late father. The incumbent civilian administration of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo has intensified his probe into my late father's activities while in the office and he has frozen all our local and foreign accounts together with  other assets of my family as a retaliation for what my late father did to him when he was alive as the Head of the Military regime in Nigeria.  As a matter of fact, we have been declared bankrupt and they are not relenting to make us poor for life.As a man that is so traumatized, I have lost confidence with anybody within my country as all those who benefited immensely during the regime of my late father have openly abandoned all my family.   MY REASONS FOR CONTACTING YOU. I got your contacts through my personal research and out of desperation decided to reach you through this medium.   You must have heard over the media reports and the Internet on the recovery of various huge sums of money deposited by my late father in different Banks and security firms abroad.  Some of these banks and security firms willingly gave-up/divulge their banking secrets and disclosed to the present civilian administration of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, all my family's cash lodgement and monetary transactions with them.Please my dear, I repose great confidence in you and I hope you will not betray my confidence in you.   I have secretly deposited the sum of $20,000,000.00 with a security firm abroad whose name is withheld for now until we open communications. The money is contained in a metal box consignment with Security Deposit Number.I shall be grateful if you could receive this fund into your Bank account for safekeeping.  This arrangement is known to you and my junior brother (Abbas) only. So I will deal directly with you. I am proposing a 20% share of the fund to you for your kind assistance. I shall provide for you all the documents of the fund deposit with the security firm, and raise a power of attorney `to enable you claim and receive this fund into your bank account. Also this transaction demands absolute disclose it to anybody  irrespective of your relation with the person.  Remember, loose lips sinks ship I am looking forward to your urgent and positive response via my email =. abacha2@webmail.co.za.  Best regards Alhaji Mohammed Abacha.",1

phishing,legitimate,True,"REPLY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE   MR. MING YANG HANG SENG BANK LTD. 83, Des Voeux Road., Central HK, Hong Kong. mingyang_h@yahoo.com.hk  Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Ming Yang director of operations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd. I have an obscured business suggestion for you.  Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client Gen. Aadel Akgaal Bastaan  who was with the Iraqi forces and also businessman made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several notices was sent to him, even during the war which began in 2003. Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the General along with his wife and only daughter had been killed during the war in a bomb blast that hit their home. You can read more about the bombings on visiting these sites below:  1. http://www.ccmep.org/usbombingwatch/2003.htm#3/19/03  2. http://civilians.info/iraq/deaths_data.php   After further investigation it was also discovered that Gen. Aadel Akgaal Bastaan  did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Twenty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the laws of my country at the expiration 3 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Gen. Aadel Akgaal Bastaan  so that you will be able to receive his funds.  WHAT IS TO BE DONE:  I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Gen. Aadel Akgaal Bastaan, all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favour for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.  There is no risk involved at all in this matter, as we are going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue. Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall then share in the ratio of 70% for me, 30% for you. Should you be interested please send me your full names, private phone/fax and current residential address and I will prefer you reach me on my private email address below: mingyang_h@yahoo.com.hk and finally after that I shall provide you with more details of this operation.  Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.

phishing,legitimate,True,"letter from smith Direct and private cell number +447024075280 Direct and private Telephone + 448714749902 Direct and private fax number + 448701310683 Dear Friend,  I am Mr. T. smith, deputy senior regional manager at Lloyds TSB Commercial Finance in Yorkshire. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 2000, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit  for forty-eight months, (being four years) valued at US$40,000,000.00, (forty Million, Dollars) in my branch.  Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his employers, that Mr. Barry Kelly died from tsunami on his holidays in Thailand 26 December 2004. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$40,000,000 has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for Safekeeping .No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to British Law, at the expiration of (three) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the British Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to stand in as the owner  of the money I deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes though  the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as I tagged them to be photographic materials for export. I am writing you because I as a public servant (Manager with the bank), I cannot operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than $1m. I want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. This is simple. I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the as the owner of the boxes.  The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 30% for you. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email address upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in (Buying of properties like houses, hotels and doing charity works etc) Please do send me your private/mobile telephone fax number so that we can have a smooth communication. Awaiting your urgent reply ONLY via my email( ttss7520062006@mixmail.com )  Thanks and regards.  TONY SMITH",1
legitimate,phishing,True,"[UAI] Submission Deadline Extended (June, 25): ICAPS PG'2007 Planning in Games [Apologies if you receive this CFP multiple times]  ====================================================================                       FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS           The ICAPS 2007 Workshop on Planning in Games              ICAPS PG 2007                  Providence, Rhode Island, USA                       September, 23, 2007             http://www.plg.inf.uc3m.es/icaps-pg2007/  Workshop Description: =====================  The two communities, planning and games, have coexisted for several decades, but have evolved with little interaction between them. While games programs have been engineered for efficiency from the early days, high-performance planners are a relatively recent development.  Both planning and games are important fields of research in the Artificial Intelligence community. A trend in the computer game community, exemplified in initiatives such as the General Game Playing Project and ORTS, has been on playing whole classes of games, and on increasing realism and complexity. This tests the limits of traditional game-tree search approaches. However, the planning community has a lot of experience in dealing with huge search spaces. Furthermore, such games also involve current topics of much current interest in planning, such as: time reasoning, resource management, imperfect information, cost-based planning, etc.  This workshop will discuss all aspects of using planning in the domain of games. Relevant topics include, but are not limited to:  - planning techniques for classical games - planning in commercial computer games - integration of planning and game tree search - representational issues: languages for planning in games - opportunities for technology transfer between the communities - competitions - planning stories and scenarios - planning and interactive narrative - integrating planning and affective systems - planning for NPCs - dialogue planning - reasoning about actions and game playing - plan recognition - learning plans  Important Dates: ================  Submission Deadline (extended):    June 25, 2007    11:59pm PST (Samoa time UTC-11)  Notifications and Technical Program:    July 13, 2007  Camera-Ready Paper Submissions:    July 31, 2007  Workshop Date:    September 23, 2007  Submission Procedure: =====================  We ask authors to submit technical papers in PDF format.

legitimate,phishing,True,"re : transitional assignments all i have received a few notes about this since this one but i will try to respond to all questions here . please see below responses in red : enron capital sally - husband and 3 children - ages 15 , 11 and 2 ) . i understand that the houses which have been vacated due to returning expats have all been filled , so can you have someone arrange for corporate housing that will accommodate them ? i think the best way to go here is for us to use serviced apartments as it will be very difficult to find a lease for such a short period for this type of accommodation . my assistant , lisa , has put a call in to a service who can help us find serviced accommodation in south kensington / chelsea area or in dolphin square where we have people now who are very satisfied . is there a reason you are partial to south kensington / chelsea ? what if we find accommodation in another nice area of london within a short commute to the office ? when i have some options , i will let you know , probably on monday . immigration - due to the fact that they will be traveling back and forth and have made trips already , i feel it would be best to apply for work permits versus using the visa waiver . i have sent them the forms and requested that brent complete his and file immediately to increase chances of getting his sometime shortly after he arrives in the uk . i have informed him that he should arrive without his family if the permit has not been received by april 1 . brent ' s work permit will be submitted today and we may receive if before april lst , but it is unlikely . the way it works for this is as follows : brent will receive the work permit from us and if he is here , he will have to leave the uk and enter with the work permit for it to be validated . if his family are in houston , they will need to receive entry clearance in the us prior to arriving in the uk . this takes approx 7 working days and they will require either brent ' s original passport and work permit or a certified copy of each along with other things such as marriage and birth certificates . if brent decides to bring his family with him to london prior to receiving the work permit , they must say they are coming on a vacation for a short period of time and have a return ticket to back it up . once the permit is received , the family can either travel back to houston and submit the entry clearance visas there or they can all travel to amsterdam where they are currenlty issuing entry clearance without a problem . there is always a small element of risk in going to amsterdam , however , as do not have to issue the stamps there , they just do it because they are nice ! work permits are arriving approx 4 weeks from date of submission . we can discuss all of this on the 20 th . tax - please confirm whether paye will need to be paid for them during the short term assignment and then reclaimed through a treaty benefit . paye is due after 60 days ; however , if brent and sally are really only going to be here for approx 75 days , i am not going to inform the revenue that they are here . if this extends beyond the set time , we can look at options but the only responsiblility that brent and sally will have is to ensure they complete the tax organiser in order for us to get the tax back . also , as we would have to apply the treaty here , we need to ensure the salary costs stay in houston . jane , have you discussed this point ? benefits - i have suggested that they remain on us domestic payroll and benefits and , if medical claims arise that exceed what they would have spent in the us , they may claim the excess on the expense report . agreed . per diem - we need to discuss the appropriate amount based on family size . jane , please call me to discuss . i have left you a message , thanks let me know of any other issues we need to address . as always , i appreciate your help . jane",0

phishing,legitimate,True,"GOOD DAY CONFIDENTIAL/URGENT BUSINESS PROPOSAL. Dear Friend,  I am delighted to write this letter to you hoping that you will understand my predicament and answer back without hesitation.  I am Dr Maryam Abacha the wife of the late Nigerian head of State General Sani Abacha. I got your contact on the internet as I was making contact for a honest foreigner who will help save my life and my children, hence our country has been frustrating us since the death of my husband.  I am in possession of $25 000.000 (TWENTY FIVE MILLION U.S DOLLARS ONLY) which I want to invest in your country. For your clarification and understanding,this money in a box which my husband deposited in the finance and security company in dis-guise as a family treasure since 11th of febuary 1998, is not an ill gotten wealth rather, it was generated from my organisation FAMILY SUPPORT PROGRAM (F.S.P). I will enlighten you more of this organisation if you indicate a helping interest to secure this money on my behalf.  On your acceptance to render this assistance to me,I will instruct the finance company to effect a change of ownership of this fund in your name as the bona-fide owner to enable you claim the fund from the security and finance company,also I will disclose to you the country and the name of the finance and security company where this money is being deposited.  What I demand from you now is to arrange for a visit to the finance company where this money is being deposited and claim it as the bona-fide owner.It is very ideal you forward to me your private telephone and fax numbers to enable me send all relevant documents pertaining the deposit of this fund for your clarification and more understanding.  Bear in mind that this transaction demands absolute confidentiality because properties and bank accounts both local and international bearing the Abacha's family name, are being ordered to be confiscated by the newly elected civilian President of Nigeria (President Olusegun Obasanjo) hence I will not want to be exposed.  Let me refer you to the front page of This Day Newspapers of 10th March 2001. You can check it through their website:www.thisdayonline.com , click on archives,8th.june,2001) The present government in Nigeria had frozen and seized all my bank accounts both here in Nigeria and abroad.  Thus l shall expect you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss in detail about this transaction For your knowledge, 25% of this fund $25 000.000 (TWENTY FIVE MILLION U.S DOLLARS) will be given to you if you assist me to secure this fund and another 5% has been set aside for all the expenses you might incure during the process of securing this fund.Example: TELEPHONE BILLS, HOTEL BILLS, FLIGHT BILLS and other mislenous expenses.  When you must have taken the agreed percentage, you will use part of the balance to buy a living house for my family there in your country, where we shall live in the future and the remaining part will be kept for investment package also in your country which will be under your supervision.  Contact me through my son (OMAR ABACHA) who recently escaped from Nigeria to Johannesboug South Africa where he is now staying as a refuge on his email address omarabacha@hotmail.com to avoid us losing this money, since it is the only remaining fund for the survival of my family.  Thanks for your anticipated co-operation. Yours sincerely,  MRS.MARYAM ABACHA  Please for security reasons reply to my alternative email address:mrs.maryam_abacha@outgun.com       __________________________________________________________________ Get Tiscali Broadband From 15:99 http://www.tiscali.co.uk/products/broadbandhome/",1

However, weak market fundamentals, including a sluggish economy and increased  US and Canadian supplies, will mitigate the usual winter price rise. CERA  expects an average Henry Hub price of $2.35 in November.  *  Although inventories are close to record levels, storage pressures are  increasingly unlikely to drive cash markets down significantly this year.   *  Gas demand will average 14 percent lower than a year earlier; residential  and commercial sectors show a decline with a return to normal weather, while a  weak economy offsets the return of ammonia and dual-fuel loads in the  industrial sector.  *  Regional storage inventories and weak regional demand should keep upward  pressure off of regional differentials.

[news;abr=!ie;sz=336x280;ord=4566417933?]      [ew_spacer.gif]     ""We must make sure that our immigration policies don't have a backlash    effect  on displacing American workers,"" Chambliss said Tuesday. ""[The    bill]  will  end the practice of companies who are displacing American    workers.""     The  Senate  Judiciary  Committee  Tuesday  took a look at the role of    temporary work visas in the current economy. The technology industry's    use  of  H-1B  visas  dropped approximately 75 percent last year, with    initial  H-1B visa applications falling to 26,659 in 2002 from 105,692    in  2001,  according  to the Department of Homeland Security Office of    Immigration Security.     Despite  the  statistics,  as unemployment rises in the United States,    lawmakers are hearing from their constituents.     ""I  cannot  tell  you  how  many  workers  came up to me [in August in    California]  and  said, 'I've been replaced by somebody I trained, and    they're  getting  a  third  [the  salary] of what I got,'"" Sen. Dianne    Feinstein,  D-Calif.,  said  at  a  hearing  of  the  Senate Judiciary    Committee  Tuesday. ""Wherever I go, this program comes up and somebody    tells me they've been replaced, and they are angry.""     Intel  Corp.,  which  employs close to 80,000 workers worldwide, hires    individuals  through  the  H1-B  visa program when a position requires    unique  or  difficult-to-find  skills,  Patrick Duffy, human resources    attorney  at Intel, told lawmakers. Beginning in 2001, Intel decreased    hiring  overall,  but  it  continues  to  hire H-1B applicants when it    cannot  find  qualified  U.S.  workers,  Duffy  said.  The company has    particular difficulty hiring U.S. citizens for positions in electrical    engineering design and chemical engineering, he said.     Duffy  contended  that  the  H-1B  visa program does not displace U.S.    workers  and  ultimately  benefits  the  U.S.  economy.  Most  of  the    company's  H-1B visa employees studied at U.S. universities and earned    masters degrees and doctorates.     ""These are not temporary workers to us. The H-1B visa is just one step    in  making these workers U.S. workers,"" Duffy said. ""Hopefully they'll    stay with Intel ... the rest of their lives.""     Large  corporations  that  rely  on skilled foreign workers are urging    Congress  not  to pass short-term fixes that will later cause problems    when  the  economy  recovers.  In  the  boom  times  of the late '90s,    Ingersoll-Rand  Corp. had to take people off the payroll when the H-1B    hiring  cap  was  lowered,  Elizabeth Dickson, adviser for Immigration    Services  at  Ingersoll-Rand  in  Woodcliff Lake, N.J., told lawmakers    Tuesday.     ""When  the [foreign worker hiring] cap reverts to 65,000, we are going    to  have a lot of problems that we experienced both in 1997 and 1998,""    Dickson  said.  ""If  we  have a recovering economy, what are our needs    going to be long term?""     The  root of the problem, according to the industry officials, is that    Americans  earn too few graduate degrees in the hard sciences, leaving    the  domestic  pool of adequate engineering specializations too small.    Contrary  to some assertions, industry officials said they do not hire    foreign  workers  to  pay  them  less  than  they would pay Americans.    Dickson  told  lawmakers  that  it  is  more expensive to hire foreign    workers.     ""We  are  mostly  looking  to  hire U.S. workers. They're cheaper, and    there  are  a  lot  less problems,"" Dickson said. ""In the near term we    simply must have access to foreign nationals. If we want to maintain a    global edge, we want to have the best and the brightest working for us    in the United States.""     American  engineers  argue  that corporate America's use of H-1B visas    exacerbates the problem of engineering unemployment. Abuse of the visa    program,  in  particular,  leaves  qualified  Americans  out  of work,    according  to  John  Steadman,  president-elect  of  the  IEEE-USA  in    Washington, D.C.     ""If  we  continue  down  this path, the United States is making itself    increasingly  dependent  of foreign technical expertise, both here and    abroad,""  Steadman  told  lawmakers,  urging the government to support    programs  that  encourage  more  students--especially  minorities  and    women--to go into the sciences.",0

Email:clicfwanton@rixmail.se    Dear Friend,    It is with trust and confidence that I write to reveal this urgent  business relationship to you. I was assigned by two of my colleagues to  seek for a foreign partner who will assist us in providing a convenient  account in a designated bank overseas for the transfer of US$32,000,  000.00 (Thirty Two Million United States Dollars Only) pending our  arrival in your country for utilization and disbursement of the fund  with the owner of the account where the fund would be transferred  into.    On the 23rd of January 1996, our corporation, the Nigeria National  Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) awarded a contract of $120,000,000.00 (  One Hundred and Twenty Million United States Dollars) but I and my  colleagues being members of the contract award committee inflated the  contract sum to the tune of US$152,000, 000.00 with the intention of  sharing the remaining balance of US$32,000,000.00 among ourselves.    The contract has been successfully executed and the actual contractors  have been paid their US$120,000,000.00 ( One Hundred and Twenty Million  United States Dollars) in full. But what we want to transfer out of the  country in our favour for disbursement is US$32M. balance My colleagues  and I have agreed that if you / your company can act as the beneficiary  of this fund , we will transfer the funds to your account and you will  retain 30% of the total fund for assistance rendered, while we will  retain 60% of the total fund and the balance of 10% of the fund will be  set aside for the offsetting of all expenses that might be incurredby  both parties during the fund transfer process.    We request you cooperate with us and provide a convenient account  number in a designated bank where this fund can be safely transferred  to, we intend to come over to your country on the completion of the  fund transfer to secure our own share of the funds.    THE NATURE OF YOUR BUSINESS IS NOT PARTICULARLY RELEVANT FOR THE CCESS  OF THIS TRANS ACTION. ALL WE REQUIRE IS YOUR WELLINGNESS TO CO-OPERATE  AND ASSURANCE THAT OUR OWN SHARE WILL BE GIVEN TO US WHEN THIS MONEY IS  TRANSFERRED INTO YOUR ACCOUNT.ALL NECESSARY PRECAUTIONS HAVE BEEN TAKEN  TO TO ENSURE A NO RISK SITUATION ON THE SIDE OF BOTHPARTIES AND IT IS  BELIEVED THAT THIS TRANSACTION WILL LAST 20 WORKING DAYS, BARRING ANY  DELAYS.

legitimate,phishing,True,"615 PAPER 63 The three papers that we read this week deal with performance of P2P  systems. The   first one examines the ""small-world phenomenon"" - the principle that we  are all   linked by short chains of acquaintances, and its effect on the design of  P2P   systems. In this paper the authors prove that no decentralized algorithm,   operating with local information only, can construct short paths in the  family of   recently proposed network models that are rich in short paths with  non-negligible   probability. They then show that there is a unique model within the  family for   which decentralized algorithms are effective.   This results in the conclusion that   in addition to having short paths, a network should contain latent  structural   cues that can be used to guide a message towards a target, which means  that   minimizing the transmission rate of a network is not necessarily the same  as   minimizing its diameter. The second paper compares the performance of  Freenet and   Gnutella. The two systems are compared along the lines of performance,  fault   taulerance and scalability. While both Frenet and Gnutella are  decentralized   systems, Freenet relies on the ""small-world phenomenon"", while Gnutella  doesn't.   In terms of performance, Freenet has good average but bad worst case  performance.   Gnutella makes a tradeoff of a much greater search effort for optimal  paths and   better worst case performance. Since highly connected nodes are much less  a   factor in Gnutella than in Freenet, Gnutella is better at handling  attacks but   worse at handling failures. Freenet scales better than Gnutella, scaling   logarithmically compared with linearly for Gnutella. The third paper  compares the   performance of Gnutella and Napster. This paper shows that bandwidth,  latency,   availability, and the degree of sharing vary between three and five  orders of   magnitude across the peers in both Gnutella and Napster. It also shows  that peers   tend to deliberately misreport information if there is an incentive to do  so and   that the download capacities of both systems exceed their upload  capacities.   Finally it points out the fact that Gnutella has a large portion of  freeriders.   This means that a large percentage of clients rely on a small percentage  of   servers, which in turn means that the system is highly vulnerable to  targeted   attacks. It seems that it should be possible to design an unstructured  P2P system   that performs as well as a structured one. However, when designing such a  system   several things must be kept in mind: the ""small-world phenomenon"" is your  friend   - use it; different peers have significant differences in their abilities  and the   system should take that into account; freeloaders are a problem because  they not   only take up system resources but can also make the system vulnerable to  failures   and attacks, thus there have to be strong incentives for people not to  freeload.",0
