phishing,legitimate,True,"CAN I TRUST YOU ON THIS   Dear Sir/Madam Compliment of the day to you . I got your contact through business search from the internet. I am Mr.Mustapha Momodu, Account Manager of Standard Chartered Bank Kanashie Branch . I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On December 29th 2002, an American contractor with the Government of Ghana, Mr. Michael Creek made a numbered time (Fixed) deposited for twelve calendar months, valued at TWENTY TWO Million,Four hundred thousand dollars ($22.4million) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, that Mr. Michael Creek died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he did not leave a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Michael Creek did not declare any next of kin in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork. This sum of $22.4million is still sitting in Standard Chartered Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.  No one will come forward to claim it. According to the laws of the country, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to assist me fully as foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Michael creek,  so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide me immediately with your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavites, which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of two attorneys for drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 30% for you while 10% will be set aside for miscellaneous expenses. There is no risk involved in this transaction, as every necessary paperwork for this fund, will be done and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. Hope this mail will meet your perfect understanding. Best Regards. Mr.Mustapha Momodu  P/S:You can contact me also via my private email at mr_mustapha_stb@yahoo.com",1
phishing,legitimate,True,"Co-Operation FROM MR. JAMES OPOKU TEL: +233 208216645  Before I introduce myself, I wish to inform you that this letter is not  a hoax mail and I urge you to treat it serious. This letter must come  to you as a big surprise, but I believe it is only a day that people  meet and become great friends and business partners.  My name is Mr. James Opoku, the present branch Manager of a bank here  in Ghana. I write you this proposal in good faith, believing that I can  trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you. Like I  said, I have a transaction that will benefit both of us, as your  assistance is required as a foreigner. I use to head the Accounts  department in my bank head office, but last December I was asked to  take position of a Manager of our branch in Kumasi who passed on, so  that was how I became the present Manager and discovered a fortune. As  I resumed duty, I discovered an account with total sum of $12,500,000  million that has not been operated on for the past 4 years. From my  investigation, I found out that this account belongs to one Late Mr.  Morris Thompson an American great industrialist and a resident of  Alaska, who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of Alaska  Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31 2000, including his  wife and only daughter.  You shall read more news about the crash on visiting this site which I  got during my investigation;    and //www.nativefederation.org/history/people/mThompson.html  The account is escrow call account, a secret type of account in my bank  and no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning  it, the account has no other beneficiary. I have kept a close  monitoring of the account since then and nobody has come forward to ask  about the money as next of kin to the late Mr. Morris Thompson, meaning  that no one is aware of the account.  I cannot directly take out this money without the help of a foreigner  and that is why I am contacting you for an assistance to claim the  funds and share it with me. As the Manager of my bank branch, I have  the power to influence the release of the funds to any foreigner that  comes up as the next of kin to the account, with the correct  information concerning the account, which I shall give you.  I am seeking your co-operation to present you as the next of kin to the  account, so that my bank head quarters will release the funds to you.  There is practically no risk involved, the transaction will be executed  under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of  law.  If you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to  share the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied.  Contact me as soon as you receive this message if you feel we can work  together, so we can go over the details.  Thanking you in advance and may God bless you.  Please, treat with utmost confidentiality. I wait your urgent response.  You can as well contact me by phone the number is +233208216645.  Regards,  Mr. James Opoku.",1

It is in view of the above facts that i am contacting you as a  foreigner to help in transferring this Money abroad into your account  as the  current restrictions on travelling and the Fact that the Funds is in a  foreigner's name under a Foreign Account therefore the Bank officials  will wellcome any foreigner with correct information about the account  which i will give to you. Also there are other factors which has made it impossible for me to do  it as it was only possible for me to escape from Iraq to Kuwait from  where i am currently contacting you. We are going to sign a Binding agreement of Trust to makle sure that  none of the parties involved will be cheated in the transaction as i  will  travel along with my family to your Country for sharing and  Investments as soon as the ban on travelling and other restrictions is  lifted. You also have to note that after the successful transfer of the fund to  your account, it will be shared as follows: you will be given 35% of  the Total Fund for your services, 60% will be for me while the  remaining  5% will be for expenses incurred in the course of the transaction.

phishing,legitimate,True,"From: Mr.Al-Zarqawi Yusuf  From: Mr.Al-Zarqawi Yusuf  Dear Friend,  Your first reaction to this mail will be total rejection, scare and maybe disbelief, owning largely to the atrocities people commit these days.But this mail comes from a devastated, sorrowful and emotional laden soul that needs compassion from a kind and good spirited person to wipe away my tears and appropriate my dream and humanitarian gesture.  As you read this, I don't want you to  feel sorry for me, because, I believe everyone dies someday.,I am Al-Zarqawi Yusuf, A Oil merchant in Dubai, United Arab Emirate ( UAE). I have been diagnosed with Cancer, which was discovered very late, due to my laxity in caring for my health. It has defiled all forms of medicine; Right now I have only about a limited to live, according to my Medical Doctor. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for myself but the Oil business.Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.  I believe when Allah  gives me a second chance and  heal me I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it.I have sowed a seed for my healing I have willed and given most of my properties and assets to my immediate and extended family members and as well as a few close friends. i want Allah to be merciful to me and accept my soul and so, I have decided to give arms to charity organizations and give succor and comfort to the less privileged of the Tsunami and Hurricane Katrina Victims, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth so far, by distributed some of this money to some charity organizations in India,Hurricane Katrina victims in USA and other part of the world. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self anymore.I once asked members of my family  to close one of my accounts in Saudi Bank and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization and to the less  privileged in Bulgaria and Sudan.  They cashed the money but kept it only to themselves.  Hence I do not trust them anymore,as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them already.The last of my money, which no one knows of, is the huge cash deposit of Thirty Five Million United States Dollars ( US$35Million)  that I have in the Vault of The Security Company as family valuable since the year 2003 for safekeeping.I want you to collect this deposit on my behalf and disburse it to the Tsunami Earthquake victims in Asia for the less privileged. Please send me a mail to indicate your wiliness to assist in this disbursement.   I will set aside 10% for you for your time and efforts by notifying the security company as soon as i hear from you.I need your urgent reply with your full name and address, your Phone and Fax numbers and your Occupation so that I will not have to go on sourcing for a credible person to handle this project for himself and the rest of the less privileged.I will also plead to you to always pray for me because only Allah heals.

phishing,legitimate,True,"KINDLY ASSIST URGENT RESPONSE  Hi Friend, In recent times over the radio in AMERICA or even in ASIA you must have heard about my family regarding huge sums of money stacked in foreign banks in different names for business. I believe, is a legacy we came to meet, when my late Husband became the head of state. It does not matter whether you are small or big but your ability to help me sort out things is mostly needed now. I do not justify myself but it has happened, so i need you to help me and my family survive in life.Thus it is with hope that I write to  seek your help in the context below.  I am Hajia Mariam Abacha, wife of Nigeria's former head of state; Late General Sani Abacha, whose sudden death occurred on the 8th of June 1998.  Since my husband died, I have been thrown into a state of utter confusion, frustration and hopelessness by the present civilian administration.  The security agents in the country have subjected me to physical and psychological torture. My son (Mohammed Abacha) is still under detention arraigned before the federal high court of Nigeria for an offence he did not commit. As a widow that has been traumatized, I am hopeless with my present faith. You must have heard over the media reports on the recovery of various sums of money deposited by  my late husband with various security firms. Some companies willingly gave up their secret and disclosed  our money confidently lodged there, or many, outright blackmail. Infact the total sum discovered by the government so far is in the tune of $700 to $600 Million USD and they are not relenting to make me poor for life.   I came in contact with your name and address through my personal research and would want to have faith and confidence in you as I view you to be of responsible personality. I have no doubt about your capacity and goodwill to assist me in receiving into your custody (for safety) the sum of $70.3 Million USD willed and deposited safely in my favour by my late husband. This money  is currently kept in Safe Deposit Box (SDB) at a security firm within Europe.  As it is legally required, the administration of my late husband's property is under the authority of the family's Lawyer(Attorney).  The investigative teams set up by my government have submitted their report after freezing almost all our account.Fortunately, our family lawyer had secretly protected the personal will of my husband from the notice of the investigators and have strictly advised that the$70.3m USD be urgently moved to an overseas account of any trust worthy but ANNONYMOUS foreign family   friend without delay, for security reasons.All our traveling papers have been seized by the government thereby preventing us from traveling and all the local and international outfit of our business empire seized.  This sum of money is our only hope to stay alive. I have therefore agreed to compensate your good self with 30% of the total deposit only when you recieve the deposit box from the security firm and its contents safely lodged in your account. They have equally guaranteed 100% risk-free and smooth transfer. If you are interested in assisting me, please reach me immediately and send to me your confidential telephone and fax number(s) so that I or my son mustapha can reach you as soon as possible.   For obvious security reasons, it is imperative that you  keep all our communication very secret. Do not mention my family`s name or disclose the transaction to anybody. If you are not interested in assisting me, please still get in touch so that I can make alternative arrangement as time is of the essence.Please do not expose me to my government.

legitimate,phishing,True,"RE: Redfield Deliverability Project I would appear to me that there may be some misconceptions here.     Why do we assume that by entering into a financing deal we will be any better off?  I would tell you that to the extent there was any risk in the deal, that we should probably charge someone else about 25-30% as well.     Think about it, 25% is only 15% after tax.   Has some one enumerated the risks and valued them on this deal?   I haven't seen any of that work, if it has been done.           I think I understand the concept proposed and I understand the proposed goal line, return with little or no expense up front.     I would assume that we would be willing to enter into a fixed price service agreement for a number of years?     Is Halliburton willing to take any risks whatsoever?  Alternatively, why don't we go through GSS (Global Strategic Sourcing) to look for a better deal?	  Jim:   Have you looked at this for ideas on the accounting side?    Why can't I do a prepayment of a service contract fee and recognize the expense over the life of the deal?   -----Original Message----- From: 	Waymire, Dave   Sent:	Wednesday, October 17, 2001 9:17 AM To:	Hayslett, Rod; Gilbert, Steve Cc:	Centilli, James Subject:	RE: Redfield Deliverability Project  Rod,  Below is some background on the Redfield Deliverability Project.  Halliburton initiated the contact with NNG to provide work over on selected wells based on software modeling in order to return deliverability to their original levels.  The work overs are planned over a 2-3 year period and are expected to have a lasting effect of at least 10 years.  The cost to model and rework these wells is estimated to be $5.73MM.  A test program would be conducted in the first year to determine the feasibility of continuing the program at a cost of $768,000.  If the test program did not prove out the project would be terminated at this point.  The original proposal was to treat the costs of the program as expense as the costs were incurred. Bob Chandler confirmed this accounting treatment.  This would result as Kent has indicated negative EBIT for the first 2-3 years.   As an alternative it was proposed to Halliburton that NNG would enter into a 10 year service agreement with Halliburton to model and rework the wells and provide guidance on proposed well work overs for the Redfield storage field.  Halliburton would agree to perform the test program and if test results indicate that further work overs would be economically feasible would spend an additional $4.96MM on a total of 60 well workovers in the first 3 years of the contract.  NNG currently budgets $300,000 per year for Redfield well maintenance with minimal increase in deliverability. Operations has committed $300,000 per year in well maintenance over the next 5 years to this project for a total of $1.5MM.  Halliburton has not formalized their counter offer, but has indicated that they would require a 25% to 30% return for assuming the financing.  Halliburton indicated that this is a non-standard deal for them and that is the reason for high return requirement.    The objective is to structure the deal as a service agreement either with an Enron Entity who would then contract with Halliburton or some other third party at a more reasonable rate.  Even at an estimated 30% return, preliminary incremental EBIT estimates for the Halliburton service agreement are between $400,000 to $500,000 the first 5 years and  $250,00 to $275,000 for the out years.       -----Original Message----- From: 	Hayslett, Rod   Sent:	Friday, October 12, 2001 7:05 AM To:	Gilbert, Steve Cc:	Waymire, Dave Subject:	RE: Redfield Deliverability Project  Couple of quick comments.    Prepaying as an expense would require coming up with some income to offset, and generally doesn't make economic sense.   An Enron company can't help because it consolidates, and therefore ends up with the same accounting results as we do.       What accountants have reviewed the proposal?   -----Original Message----- From: 	Miller, Kent   Sent:	Thursday, October 11, 2001 9:52 AM To:	Hayslett, Rod; McCarty, Danny Cc:	Waymire, Dave; Neubauer, Dave; Neville, Sue; Thomas, Steve Subject:	Redfield Deliverability Project  Rod,  We looking for your help on some ideas on how to implement a good long term project that has negative short term cash flow.  We have been working with Halliburton to identify deliverability improvements at Redfield through the use of  improved technology related to identifying poor performing wells and implementing down hole remediation.  This project has costs and revenues as shown below that are great from a long term standpoint.  Steve Thomas and Maurice Gilbert have done an excellent job of identifying the benefits to NNG and the upsides in revenue that are expected.  Dave Waymire has also been very helpful in analyzing alternative and economics and have shown that the project has a great return (in excess of 30%).  Our problem is that the cost for the workovers at Redfield are all O&M expenses and not capital and we have a negative IBIT for the first 2 - 3 years of the project.  We have proposed that Halliburton structure the expenses such that they come in over a 5 - 10 year period so we don't have this negative IBIT flow in the first years, however, Halliburton has not been interested and has proposed a 30% finance charge for this structure.  What would be the appetite for possibly pre-paying a majority of these costs in '01 to avoid the negative '02 and '03 earnings impact or is there an Enron company that would finance/extend the expense payments.

phishing,legitimate,True,"THE GREATEST IS LOVE  Dear Friend, As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because,I  believe everyone will die someday.  My name is Umaru Aliyu, a merchant in Dubai, in the U.A.E.I have been  diagnosed with Esophageal cancer caring for my health.It has defiled  all forms of medicine, and right now I have only about a few months to  live, according to medical experts.I have not particularly lived my  life so well, as I never really cared for anyone not even myself but my  business.  Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to  people and only focus on my business as that was the only thing I cared  for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life  than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.I believe  when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it.Now that God  has called me, I have willed and given most of my properties and assets  to my immediate and extended family members and as well as a few close friends. I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul and so, I have decided to give alms to charity organizations,as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I did on earth.  So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the  U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so  badly, I cannot do this my self any more. I once asked members of my  family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I  have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan,they refused  and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seems not to be contended with what I have left for them.  The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of  twenty four million dollars $24,000,000,that I have with a  Bank/Security Company abroad. I will want you to help me collect this  deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations.Please indicate your  intention to help through this email Address (aliyuumaru@mail2world.com)immediately.  And always remember that I have set aside 20% for you for your time  and patience.I await your urgent response to this request.Thanks may  God bless you and your family (AMEN).

phishing,legitimate,True,"PLEASE ASSIST ME Hello Friend,   My name is Mr. PETER k. KHAN the auditor and head of computing department of a bank here in london,UnitedKingdom.There is an account opened in this bank in 1995 and since my inception into office in 2000, nobody has operated on this account again, after going through some old files, I discovered that if I do not remit this money out urgently, it will be forfeited for nothing. In order to transfer out fifteen-million pounds sterling) from our bank here have the courage to look for a reliable and honest person who will be capable for this important transaction, believing that you will never let me down either now or in future.  HOW THE MONEY CAME ABOUT   The owner of this account was Mr. John Hughes who was a foreigner and the manager of Petro chemical service here in London, a chemical engineer by profession and he died since 1997.And then, since 2001, nobody knows about this account or anything concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that his company does not know anything about this account and the amount involved is (15,000,000.00) pounds sterling.I want to transfer this money into a safe foreign account abroad but I don't know any foreigner, I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to any local bank here in london, but can only be approved to any foreign account because the money is pounds sterling?s and the former owner of the account is John Hughes and he was a foreigner too.

phishing,legitimate,True,"URGENT ASSISTANCE PARAMOUNT SECURITY COMPANY HOLLAND, LAGOS BRANCH. Private Email:{femimartins876@fsmail.net  Dear Friend, I am Mr.femimartins,Manager of paramount security company, Lagos Branch. I apologize for using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that your enviable credentials/particulars were given to me by a member of the South African Export Promotion Council who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as confidential because of the nature of this transaction . I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On Dec. 19, 1998, a Canadian Oil consultant/contractor with the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, Mr. Antoine Blanc made a numbered timed(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty Five Million Dollars)in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Ministry of Energy and Natural resources that Mr. Antoine Blanc died from a plane crash. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a Will, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was futile. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Antoine Blanc did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my security company. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my security company and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 6 (six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as an Foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Antoine Blanc so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of one Attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account either newly created or existing in any part of the world which you will provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 75% for me and 20% for you. Then 5% will be used to offset any expenses incurred during the entire processing. Please your percentage is not negotiable. it is considerate enough. There is no risk at all as the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney, and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.  If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email address below. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. I am awaiting your urgent reply via my email: .femi-martin876@fsmail.net  However, after your initial response by email, I would suggest that you contact me via phone 234 8055467101, for a verbal and detailed explanation of this transaction .This is imperative, because I would like to speak with you in order to be sure of who I would be with carrying out this transaction with.

phishing,legitimate,True,"YOUR URGENT FUND TRANSFER ASSISTANT IS NEEDED PLEASE Dear Friend,   With warm heart I offer my friendship, and my greetings, and I hope this letter meets you in good time. It will be surprising for you to receive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally. However, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction, which I propose with my free mind and as a person of integrity.  My name is Peter  Steven the first son of  Dr Steven Ubanko a  farmer from Zimbabwe, murdered in the land dispute. As led by my instinct , I decided to contact you through LETTER as it is the only means I can contact anybody since I am cutting off ties with Zimbabwe for security and safety reasons.  However, I apologize if this is not acceptable to you.     The purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance in a business venture. Due to the land and political problems in Zimbabwe, as a result of President Robert Mugabe's introduction of new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and the few  rich black farmers, and his desire to hold on to power for life, my father foresaw the danger that is coming to Zimbabwe. Before he was murdered, he withdrew all of our business foreign accounts in dollars to Johannesburg, South Africa to deposit the sum of US$14 millions(Fourteen  million,  US dollars), in a private security company.  This money was deposited with this Private Security Company for safety and security reasons, and was to be used for the purchase of land, new machines and chemicals establishment of new farms in Botswana.  I am currently staying in The Netherlands where I am seeking political asylum. In fact my decision to come here to seek asylum, is because the financial company from South Africa, has a branch here, and they have moved the deposited fund from their office in Johannesburg to Netherland  Since the law of The Netherlands prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction,  this is why  I am seeking your help as a reliable partner, If you accept to assist me, we shall negotiate your percentage of the total sum of the fund as my partner.  All I want you to do for me, is to assist with arrangements to claim the deposit from the financial institution, from their office here in  The Netherlands, as it has now been transferred from Johannesburg, South Africa to their branch here.  The company will be legally informed of you representing me.Please, I want you to  maintain the absolute secrecy for the purpose  of this transaction.  I look forward to your reply and co-operation, and I  thank you in advance as I anticipate your co-operation,  I will like if you  reply with my email address which is petersteven5@netscape.net  Thanks you sir, Peter Steven Ubanko",1

phishing,legitimate,True,"BUSINESS DEAL(URGENT). FROM THE DESK OF:MR.BRIAN CAPON NATIONAL WESTMINISTER BANK, LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM.  Dear Friend,  I am Mr.Brian Capon the system and control director at the NATIONAL WESTMINISTER BANK.I am writing this letter to solicit for support and assistance from you to carry out this business opportunity in my bank.  Lying in an inactive account is the sum of 11million pounds sterling belonging to a foreign customer(Michael Gambone) who was a gas consultant here in UK,who happens to be deceased during a business trip. He died with his wife(Deborah Gambone) on board the Swissair Flight 111 , which crashed into the Atlantic off Nova Scotia in september 2nd 1998. The news of this crash was on the news which we have notified his relatives to no avail.See links below for more detail information:  http://cnnstudentnews.cnn.com/WORLD/9809/swissair.victims.list/ http://cnnstudentnews.cnn.com/WORLD/americas/9809/08/swissair.02/  Ever since he died the bank has been expecting his next of kin to come and claim these fund. To this effect, we can not release the money unless someone applies for it as next of kin, as indicated in our banking guideline.Unfortunately he has no family member in UK or Over-sea who are aware of the existence of the money(as he was a gas consultant. At this juncture i have decided to do business with you by soliciting your assistance in applying as the next of kin to the bank then the money will be released to you,as I do not want this money to go into the bank treasury as an unclaimed bill,because the banking law and guideline stipulates that if such money(s) remains unclaimed  for a period of up to nine years(9yrs),the money will be transferred into the bank treasury as an unclaimed bill. My request for a foreigner as next of kin is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a British cannot stand as next of kin.  50% of the money will be your share as a foreign partner and your assistance to actualise this business,thereafter i will visit your country with your help once the money hits your account for disbursement according to the percentage indicated. To effect the immediate transfer of the fund to you as agreed,you must apply first to the bank as the next of kin to the deceased,then we will follow up all formalities for the transaction.  Upon receipt of your reply, i will send to you, the text of the application you are to send to the bank,and further clearify you in other issues as to effect this business. Awaiting to hear from you urgently.  Best Regards Mr.Brian Capon.",1

phishing,legitimate,True,"st0ck rum0rs that bec0me true and pr0fitable Bio-Matrix Scientific Gr0up, Inc.  Symbo|: BMXG.PK Industry: Biotechno|ogy; Stem Cel| Techno|ogies. Current Price: .85 Shares Out.: 8.0 Million Est. F|oat: 2.5 Mi|lion  Projected Valuation: 3.5O per share   Bio-Matrix Scientific- Banking on Stem Cel| Research.  BMXG is a stem cel|-oriented biotechnology R&D firm, which is opening  two innovative Adu|tStem ce|l cryogenic banks.  Cryobanks wi|l provide  near-term revenue stream whi|e BMXG develops new and innovative stem  cell technologies and products.   The Stem Cel| Revo|ution:  With breakthroughs in the |ate 1990's, stem cel| research has been one  of the most exciting deve|opments in biotechno|ogy, promising to aid in  the treatment or cure of degenerative and chronic diseases, including  |eukemia, cancer, and diabetes.  Scientists say stem ce|ls are the  future of medical science, offering potentia| cures to a host of  diseases  and degenerative conditions.  Market research firm, visiongain has  estimated that stem cel| products wi|l account for over 1O bil|ion in  annual  sales by 2O13- phenomenal growth for an industry which did not exist  on|y a few years ago.  One of the most significant, near-term  commercia|ization opportunities for this research has been in the use  of stem  ce|ls for bone marrow transplant.  Increasing|y, individua|s are  choosing  to store their own stem cel|s in cryogenic banks for future use in  fighting disease.  A new industry of cord b|ood banks and specialized  transplant c|inics has a|ready risen to meet this demand, and  successful  technology cou|d meet the annua| need for over 150,00O operations.  Viace|l  has estimated that the market for cord b|ood preservation is over 1.2  bi|lion in the US, and 2 bil|ion globa||y.  For our most recent Active Trader's profi|e, we have discovered a smal|  rapidly emerging company that is quick|y becoming a major player in the  stem cel| revolution, Bio-Matrix Scientific.   About the Company: BMXG  Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp., Inc. (OTC Pink Sheets: BMXG) is an  innovative biotechno|ogy R&D company, focused on the commercia|ization  of new  and groundbreaking stem cel| technologies.  The Company has focused its  initia| efforts on the |aunch of an innovative Adu|tCryogenic stem ce|l  bank which wi|l store stem ce|l tissues for use in treatment of future  diseases and ai|ments.  The Company p|ans to |aunch its initial  cryogenic stem ce|| facilities in mid-20O5, and is additiona|ly  exp|oring  opportunities for commercialization of new technologies in tissue  management, stem ce|l research instrumentation, and bio-systems  monitoring.   With impending establishment of an AdultStem cel| cryobank, research  efforts at the forefront of the stem ce|l market, and experienced  management  team, we expect Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp. to emerge as the newest and  most dynamic p|ayer in the explosive stem ce|l research market.   Investment Highlights:  BMXG is exceptionally we|| positioned at the forefront of one of the  most exciting new frontiers in biotech- stem cel| research.  Whi|e stem  ce|| therapy is still a new concept, expectations are high with  research  firm visiongain estimating that stem cell product revenues wi|l exceed  10 bil|ion by 2O13.  Recent|y, Ca|ifornia voters approved Proposition  71, a landmark piece of legis|ation that provides 3 bi|lion in stem  cel|  funding over the next decade.  With its initial focus on the establishment of stem ce|l cryogenic stem  ce|| storage faci|ities, BMXG is well situated in a growing and  commercia|ly successful market.  There are more than 10 major cord  b|ood banks  in the world, preserving ce|ls from more than 35,0OO donors.  Viacel|  has estimated that this market is 1.2 billion in the US and over 2  bi||ion wor|dwide.  As the pub|ic understanding of stem ce|| benefits  improves, we expect this niche market to enjoy exponential growth.  As  the  foremost stem cel| banker focused on the storage of Adu|tStem-cel|  growth  BMXG is a trendsetter in this market.  BMXG is making aggressive entry into the stem cell instrumentation  market with deve|opment of new medical devices specifical|y designed to  facilitate the removal and transp|ant of stem ce||s.  The Company is in  the process of securing patent protection for its inte||ectua|  properties, and we expect this to prove a major growth catalyst for  BMXG going  forward.  The Company benefits from a surprisingly strong (for a Pink Sheets  Company) and experienced management team, who have combined financial  acumen with scientific savvy to present a unique and promising mode|  for  growth in the stem ce|l market.  The Company's senior management team,  he|med by David Koos, PhD, has extensive experience in capita|  financing  and public company management, while its research efforts under Dr.  Phi|ip Watts (PhD- Ca|tech) are involved in the newest academic  research  into stem ce|l.   Investment Conclusion: Projected Va|uation: 3.5O per share  Wa|l Street has been quick to the react to the potential of stem cel|  research and stem cell stocks are outperforming a|l of the major  biotech  indices.  Leading stem cel| research companies such as StemCe|ls, Inc.  (STEM), Aastrom Biosciences (ASTR), and Cryo-Ce|| (CCEL) have witnessed  average 52 week share price appreciation of over 23O%! With its  enviab|e position in stem cel| research, strong management team, and  cryobank  operations, we think BMXG has the potential to demonstrate this type of  performance over the coming year, and urge you to consider adding BMXG  to your portfo|io today.

phishing,legitimate,True,"for assistant Dear Sir, I am Alhaji Mohammed Abacha, the son of the late Nigerian Head of State who died on the 8th of June 1998 while in active services. Following the sudden death of my father, General Sani Abacha, the present Civilian Government has thrown my family and I into a state of utter confusion,  frustration,and hopelessness.  I have been subjected to inhuman physical and physiological torture, incarceration by the security Agents in my country. I was only recently released from detention after been arraigned before the Federal High Court of Nigeria for an offence committed by my late father. The incumbent civilian administration of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo has intensified his probe into my late father's activities while in the office and he has frozen all our local and foreign accounts together with  other assets of my family as a retaliation for what my late father did to him when he was alive as the Head of the Military regime in Nigeria.  As a matter of fact, we have been declared bankrupt and they are not relenting to make us poor for life.As a man that is so traumatized, I have lost confidence with anybody within my country as all those who benefited immensely during the regime of my late father have openly abandoned all my family.   MY REASONS FOR CONTACTING YOU. I got your contacts through my personal research and out of desperation decided to reach you through this medium.   You must have heard over the media reports and the Internet on the recovery of various huge sums of money deposited by my late father in different Banks and security firms abroad.  Some of these banks and security firms willingly gave-up/divulge their banking secrets and disclosed to the present civilian administration of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, all my family's cash lodgement and monetary transactions with them.Please my dear, I repose great confidence in you and I hope you will not betray my confidence in you.   I have secretly deposited the sum of $20,000,000.00 with a security firm abroad whose name is withheld for now until we open communications. The money is contained in a metal box consignment with Security Deposit Number.I shall be grateful if you could receive this fund into your Bank account for safekeeping.  This arrangement is known to you and my junior brother (Abbas) only. So I will deal directly with you. I am proposing a 20% share of the fund to you for your kind assistance. I shall provide for you all the documents of the fund deposit with the security firm, and raise a power of attorney `to enable you claim and receive this fund into your bank account. Also this transaction demands absolute disclose it to anybody  irrespective of your relation with the person.  Remember, loose lips sinks ship I am looking forward to your urgent and positive response via my email =. abacha2@webmail.co.za.  Best regards Alhaji Mohammed Abacha.",1

It has been evident for a while now that the prices for foward months would be going down, but this is the first day I'm hearing that ProCaribe wants revised invoices.  It doesn't need to be said that cash forecasting is very important to Enron at this time and based on previous conversations, I had confirmed to the forecasting group that they would receive the funds today.  The revised invoices will be issued tomorrow.  I need confirmation that the payment of the balance due will be made tomorrow, without fail.  Per my calculations, balance due would be $1,406,580.96 taking into account the $1,000,00.00 payment that was made today.  Please confirm.

I am Mr.Anuka Ifufeh, the Auditor General of  NED BANK PLC here South Africa, during the  course of our auditing, I  discovered a floating fund in an account opened in the bank 1995 and  since 1998 nobody has operated on this account again.After going  through some old files in the records I discovered that the owner of  the account died without a [heir] hence  the money is floating and if I  do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing.  The owner of this account is Mr. Franklin Sullivan, a foreigner, a  miner and an industrialist.He made millions of dollars before he died  misteriously .Since 1998 no other person knows about this account or  any thing concerning it. My investigation proved to me that the account  has no other beneficiary and that Mr. Franklin Sullivan until his death  was the manager Sullivan Coy. (pty). SA. We will start the first  transfer with Thirty six million dollars [$36,000,000.00] upon  successful transaction without any disappoint from your side, we shall  re-apply for the payment of the remaining amount to your account.  The  amount involved is (USD $136M) Thirty Six Million United States Dollars  only.

This money came as a result of a payback contract deal between my husband  and a Russian firm in our country.The Russian partners returned my husbands  share .Presently, the Government has intensified their probe in to my  husbands financial resources which has led to the freezing of all our  accounts, local and foreign, the revoking of all our business licences and  the arrest of my First son.  In view of this I want to acted very fast to withdraw this money from one of  our finance houses before it will be closed down.My husband deposited the  money in a finance firm for safe keeping . No record is known about this  fund by the government because there is no documentation showing that we  have such funds.  Further more, my elder son have been in detention in the last four years  following the death of my late husband for charges of State organized murder  and corrupt practices. he was just been released by the Supreme Court after  the president brokered a deal with my family regarding his freedom. and he  is still under interrogation about my late husband's assets and some vital  documents.  Due to the current situation in the country and government attitude to my  family,I cannot make use of this money within, thus I seek your help in  transferring this funds out for investment than leaving the fund here and to  invest the money to profit my family Bearing in mind that you may assist  me.l have decided to part with 25% of the total sum.  I am seriously considering to settle down abroad in a friendly atmosphere  like yours as soon as this fund get into your account so that I can start  all over again if only you wish.

If this proposal satisfies you. please  do not let me out to the security as I am giving you this information in  total trust and confidence.  Please kindly reply by return mail and please include your personal  telephone and fax numbers. Conclusively,we have decided part with 25% of the  total sum. of the total sum,10% will be for expenses incurred during  thecause of this transaction, while 65% is to be held on trust by you until  we can decide on a suitable business investment in your country subsequent  to our free movement by the Senegal Government.

But former CIA Director George Tenet lets loose in our first story in a public venting rare for any public official, never mind a CIA director. Tenet angrily accuses the Bush administration of ruining his reputation by misusing his now-famous ""slam dunk"" remark about Iraqi WMD to justify its march to war. ""It's the most despicable thing that ever happened to me,"" Tenet says. ""You don't do this. You don't throw somebody overboard just because it's a deflection. Is that honorable? It's not honorable to me,"" he tells correspondent Scott Pelley.  He also reveals in this double-length segment his anguish and frustration over the 9/11 attack, the first of the president's inner circle to provide a glimpse inside it during what many would consider the country's darkest hour in modern times. You'll hear and see his feelings on the hunt for Osama bin Laden, the war on terror and its ""enhanced interrogation"" methods he says were not torture and saved lives. Pressed by Pelley to explain why, if it wasn't torture,  these individuals had to have their interrogations ""enhanced,"" Tenet, leans forward to respond, ""Because these are people who will never, ever, ever tell you a thing. These are people who know who's responsible for the next terrorist attack....[who] wouldn't blink an eyelash about killing you, your family, me and my family and everybody in this town.""          Watch  An Excerpt Of Pelley's Report.     With the questions still hovering over the massacre at Virginia Tech last week, correspondent Steve Kroft explores perhaps the biggest irony in the horrible event. It's the fact that Seung-Hui Cho, with a history of mental illness, was still able to purchase the guns he used to kill 32 innocent people, despite a 40-year-old federal law prohibiting the sale of guns to the mentally ill. Kroft reports that the law isn't enforced because many states have laws that protect the privacy of the mentally ill, advocates for whom still want their records sealed and not shared with other government agencies. Even the NRA won't go that far. The sad fact is that Cho wasn't the first mentally ill person to kill with a gun he purchased freely, nor will he be likely the last.     Watch  Kroft's Reporter's Notebook.     These stories and some interesting items from Andy Rooney's mail bag, this Sunday, April 29, on 60 Minutes at 7 p.m. ET/PT.

PLEASE EXAMINE THE ATTACHMENT AND YOU'LL SEE WHY ----- Original Message ----- From: ""Love, Phillip M.""  To:  Sent: Tuesday, January 22, 2002 7:30 AM Subject: What are you talking about $1600? I have you down for $61 plus shipping, not $1,600.  I show that you bid at $6.99 and at $61.  There was no bid for $19.99 listed at all.  I am sorry if you did not mean to bid $61, but it is hardly out of the range - these balls were selling this weekend for $80-90.  If your winning bid was $200 or higher I could understand your complaint and we could make an adjustment, but $61 is not an unreasonable amount.  Please let me know if you are planning on paying the $61(I will pay shipping if you use PayPal).  If not, I need to contact EBay for resolution.  I need a response as soon as possible.  Thanks.

You have to make sure your locale is set to ja_JP.UTF-8  and you need to  make sure that kinput2 is working properly. This will involve having  kinput2 and cannaserver both running.  Here is more information:  http://dspnet.fr/~lonewolf/LinuxJapan/Howto_English_Japanese.html  Make sure that the XMODIFIERS environment variable is set such as this  XMODIFIERS=""@im=kinput2""  Then you can test input first using notepad.  run ~/cxoffice/bin/wine  notepad then try inputing Japanese into notepad.  Then it should also work in MS  Office 2003.  thanks -aric   Gernot Hassenpflug wrote: > Hello all, >  > I have Debian GNU/linux unstable running with wine 0.9.54 and tried to > install MS Office 2003 under wine and using Crossover Office 6.0., but have > no figured out how to use the IME.

Meanwhile all the whole arrangement  to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get  the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been  put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as  soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist, and also  benefit your self to this great business opportunity.   In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this  country as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign  account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of  transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will  require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin  with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign  account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his  request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the  correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from  to your own designation bank account.   I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On  smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the  total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of  expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and  internet bills, while 60% will be for me and my coleagues. Please, you have  been adviced to keep ""Top Secret"" as I am still in service and intend to  retire from service after we conclude this deal with you.   I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm  the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for  subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated  and further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us  to invest in. All other necessary vital nformation will be sent to you when  I hear from you.   I look forward to receive your phone and fax numbers for easy communication,   Yours faithfully,   Dr Idris Ali.  _________________________________________________________________ Windows Live Messenger : venez tester la version bta !  http://www.ideas.live.com/programpage.aspx?versionId=5d21c51a-b161-4314-9b0e-4911fb2b2e6d",1
phishing,legitimate,True,"GOOD DAY CONFIDENTIAL/URGENT BUSINESS PROPOSAL. Dear Friend,  I am delighted to write this letter to you hoping that you will understand my predicament and answer back without hesitation.  I am Dr Maryam Abacha the wife of the late Nigerian head of State General Sani Abacha. I got your contact on the internet as I was making contact for a honest foreigner who will help save my life and my children, hence our country has been frustrating us since the death of my husband.  I am in possession of $25 000.000 (TWENTY FIVE MILLION U.S DOLLARS ONLY) which I want to invest in your country. For your clarification and understanding,this money in a box which my husband deposited in the finance and security company in dis-guise as a family treasure since 11th of febuary 1998, is not an ill gotten wealth rather, it was generated from my organisation FAMILY SUPPORT PROGRAM (F.S.P). I will enlighten you more of this organisation if you indicate a helping interest to secure this money on my behalf.  On your acceptance to render this assistance to me,I will instruct the finance company to effect a change of ownership of this fund in your name as the bona-fide owner to enable you claim the fund from the security and finance company,also I will disclose to you the country and the name of the finance and security company where this money is being deposited.  What I demand from you now is to arrange for a visit to the finance company where this money is being deposited and claim it as the bona-fide owner.It is very ideal you forward to me your private telephone and fax numbers to enable me send all relevant documents pertaining the deposit of this fund for your clarification and more understanding.  Bear in mind that this transaction demands absolute confidentiality because properties and bank accounts both local and international bearing the Abacha's family name, are being ordered to be confiscated by the newly elected civilian President of Nigeria (President Olusegun Obasanjo) hence I will not want to be exposed.  Let me refer you to the front page of This Day Newspapers of 10th March 2001. You can check it through their website:www.thisdayonline.com , click on archives,8th.june,2001) The present government in Nigeria had frozen and seized all my bank accounts both here in Nigeria and abroad.  Thus l shall expect you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss in detail about this transaction For your knowledge, 25% of this fund $25 000.000 (TWENTY FIVE MILLION U.S DOLLARS) will be given to you if you assist me to secure this fund and another 5% has been set aside for all the expenses you might incure during the process of securing this fund.Example: TELEPHONE BILLS, HOTEL BILLS, FLIGHT BILLS and other mislenous expenses.  When you must have taken the agreed percentage, you will use part of the balance to buy a living house for my family there in your country, where we shall live in the future and the remaining part will be kept for investment package also in your country which will be under your supervision.  Contact me through my son (OMAR ABACHA) who recently escaped from Nigeria to Johannesboug South Africa where he is now staying as a refuge on his email address omarabacha@hotmail.com to avoid us losing this money, since it is the only remaining fund for the survival of my family.  Thanks for your anticipated co-operation. Yours sincerely,  MRS.MARYAM ABACHA  Please for security reasons reply to my alternative email address:mrs.maryam_abacha@outgun.com       __________________________________________________________________ Get Tiscali Broadband From 15:99 http://www.tiscali.co.uk/products/broadbandhome/",1

phishing,legitimate,True,"letter from smith Direct and private cell number +447024075280 Direct and private Telephone + 448714749902 Direct and private fax number + 448701310683 Dear Friend,  I am Mr. T. smith, deputy senior regional manager at Lloyds TSB Commercial Finance in Yorkshire. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 2000, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit  for forty-eight months, (being four years) valued at US$40,000,000.00, (forty Million, Dollars) in my branch.  Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his employers, that Mr. Barry Kelly died from tsunami on his holidays in Thailand 26 December 2004. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$40,000,000 has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for Safekeeping .No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to British Law, at the expiration of (three) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the British Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to stand in as the owner  of the money I deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes though  the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as I tagged them to be photographic materials for export. I am writing you because I as a public servant (Manager with the bank), I cannot operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than $1m. I want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. This is simple. I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the as the owner of the boxes.  The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 30% for you. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email address upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in (Buying of properties like houses, hotels and doing charity works etc) Please do send me your private/mobile telephone fax number so that we can have a smooth communication. Awaiting your urgent reply ONLY via my email( ttss7520062006@mixmail.com )  Thanks and regards.  TONY SMITH",1

I inherited a total sum of twenty one Million five hundred thousand American dollars from my late husband, the money was concealed in a metallic trunk box and was deposited with a security company in Abidjan Cote D Ivoire, in secretly  safe keeping in the trunk box that was because I needed a maximum security/ safety of my consignment and no body know about it even the government organization can  never trace  where about of the money until I am ready and prepare to claim it. but the Security company didn't know the real content of the box,   because it was deposited as a family valuables.

agency deployments and extended operations in hazardous environments . the cobra product uses the imaging and sensing technology to provide early threat indicators for coastal surveillance and public infrastructure protection such as ports , power plants , airports , and telecommunication facilities . real time sensory and image data is processed and software is customized to discriminate between friend and foe . deepscan is a software system that provides automatic analysis of air and seaport cargo containers based on x - ray and gamma ray imaging . arroyo is currently using deepscan for bomb and hazardous material detection in cargo . ionfinity ionfinity has developed the next generation mass spectrometry ( ms ) technology that is 10 times more sensitive than existing ms , with a 10 times increase in mass range . higher sensitivity enables the comprehensive monitoring and detection of biological , chemical and nuclear contaminants . the current market for ms is estimated at $ 1 . 2 billion annually . the compact size and rugged portability will expand the market . new applications include enabling port inspection personnel to detect traces of contraband , epa air quality monitoring and assisting in hazardous material clean up . additional projects under review projects not included in our forecast are ( 1 ) a water purification technology and ( 2 ) interactive radio . the water purification system displays impressive statistics in that it can convert brackish , sewage or industrial wastewater into ultra -

(OTCBB:VNBL -  News), a holding company seeking to identify |ong-term growth  opportunities  in the areas of homeland security, security information systems, and  other  security services, announced today that it plans to offer products and  services that wi|| assist in the automation of the identification and  contro| of equipment, assets, too|s, and the re|ated processes used in  the  Oil & Gas and Petrochemical industries.  Although smal| wireless|y networked RFID sensors can monitor machines  and  equipment to detect possib|e prob|ems before they become serious, they  can  also de|iver safety features within oil we|ls. Oil maybe trapped in  different layers of rock, a|ong with gas and water. Detection of  specific  liquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise  opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur,  such as  a we|l filling with water.  As with other RF based techno|ogy applications, RFID can a|so provide  the  safe transit of materia|s by on|y the authorized handler, and limit the  entry of personne| to specific |ocations. Ensuring personnel safety is  essential, shou|d there be an emergency at a faci|ity, RFID tags would  enab|e the customer to track and evaluate its employee's safety and/or  danger. This app|ication technology requires product and hardware that  can  operate in harsh and potential|y hazardous conditions, but gives  valuable  safety to the resources and assets that are vital to the customer. RFID  can  a|so assist the customer's supp|y chain by tracking oi|, gas, and  chemica|  products from extraction to refining to the sale at the retail level.  Vinob|e's viewpoint as previously stated is that these applications are  more  than just a va|uable tool to the mining industry, but as a protective  measure of our country's natura| resources and commodities against  threat.  Preservation of these fuels and resources is important to the safety of  U.S.  industry and economy.  The Company believes that such offering service and technology  application  in the Oil & Gas and Petrochemica| industry wi|| further position  Vinob|e in  a rapid|y expanding industry whi|e taking advantage of access to the  increasing capital and global spending that the Company will require  for  growth. The Company's goa| is to a|so provide a much-needed service at  a  cost manageable to even the sma|lest of businesses that can't afford to  do  without the safety of its personne| and assets in this current state of  constant threat.   This is Outstanding news.  The growth potentia| for this company is  exceptiona|.  In an already hot industry, VNBL.OB stands out as a truly  innovative pioneer.

On June 16, 2000, a German property magnate Mr. Andrea Schranner made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months,valued at 6,500,000.00(Six Million Five Hundred Thousand Pounds Sterling )in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers (the Petroleum Corporation) that Mr. Andrea Schranner died in an air crash with his family.  On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a will and attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Andrea Schranner did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork. This sum of 6,500,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the  principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it .According to British law, at the expiration of 7 years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Bristish Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Mr. Andrea Schranner. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that an accredited Attorney working with the bank here will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin.We shall employ the service of two attorneys for the drafting and notarization of the will and obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate administration in your favour for the transfer into any bank account in any part of the world which you will provide.We will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.The money will be paid into your account for us to share in ratio of  50% for me and 30% for you and 10 % will be set aside to ofset any expenses incured during the business , while the other 10% will go to charity organisation.

But we don't really know exactly why Cho Seung-Hui went on a rampage on the campus of Virginia Tech. For our first story, correspondent Scott Pelley talks to Secret Service intelligence officers, whose exhaustive research into the minds of potential assassins and school shooters will provide valuable insights. Pelley is speaking with the officers today, April 20, and will report this story over the weekend, for what will perhaps be the freshest look yet at the mind of this mass killer.         This past week was also the deadliest in Baghdad - over 200 Iraqis were killed in a single day.  It has become a living hell for citizens of Baghdad just trying to get through an average day, as correspondent Lara Logan reports in our second story. How does one live in such a place? Very carefully, reports Logan, and often with the protection of a weapon, or in the case of Dr. Quoresh al-Kasir, the U.S. military. Nearly 200 doctors have been murdered in Iraq by insurgents intent on destroying Iraqi society. Soon after bullets began to crash through his windows, Dr. Quoresh heard a hopeful sound. ""We heard the helicopters starting to come to the area. My sons and daughter said, 'Oh, Baba, the Americans started to reach the area.'""     Watch  Logan's Reporter's Notebook.        The firing of Don Imus for uttering racially charged and misogynistic words black rap stars routinely use in their lyrics has shifted the spotlight to hip-hop culture and its dark messages.  As you'll see in our third piece, CNN's Anderson Cooper discovers that one of the rappers' popular messages, ""stop snitchin',"" does not help the police, but has actually confounded investigators' efforts to solve crimes, especially murder, and has now created some lawless neighborhoods.  Says Geoffrey Canada, educator and anti-violence advocate from New York City's Harlem neighborhood, ""It's like we're saying to the criminals, 'You can have our community....Do anything you want and we will either deal with it ourselves or we'll simply ignore it.'""     Watch  Cooper's Reporter's Notebook.        These stories, and Andy Rooney's love affair with books, this Sunday, April 22, on 60 Minutes at 7 p.m. ET/PT.

Volume Last Month: Over 7.3 Million Shares Traded Friday's Close: $.125   Watch This Stock Monday! A Large promotional Campaign is Underway This Weekend. Some of These Little Oil and Gas Stocks Have Been Really Moving Lately. And When Some of them Move, They Really Go...Gains of 100%, 200% or More Are Not Unheard Of. U-C-P-I and X-C-H-C are Two Examples..      Reasons To Consider (E O G I):  *Emerson Oil & Gas holds a 50% working interest in the W.T. Davis well and lands within Township 23 North and Range 13 West of Bossier Parish, Louisiana. The net revenue interest of the lease is 75%. The W.T. Davis Well is located in the Arkana Field and initially produced from the Haynesville Formation of the Cotton Valley Series. With the worldwide focus on energy needs being front and center in the public eye, Emerson feels that with its first class management and discretionary project choices, the company will continue to serve its shareholders well.   *Emerson is Identifying additional step out opportunities on its Louisiana property.  *Emerson has signed a letter of intent to earn 50% working interest in the Rinsland well and Lease in Bossier Parish Louisiana.  *Emerson's North-West Louisiana drilling efforts follow closely to its philosophy of high-potential low risk re-entry projects in developed fields. By maintaining this conservative, but revenue driven philosophy and mission statement, Emerson enables itself to build a strong revenue base for the company and its shareholders, while taking the lowest possible risk in achieving this goal.

If that financing does not occur, the company may not be able to continue as a going concern in which case you could lose your entire investment.

WEST AFRICA.  Dear Sir,  BUSINESS PROPOSAL AND INVESTMENT IN YOUR COUNTRY   I got your contact through our chember of commerce and  industry.  I am contacting you for a mutual business relationship and for you to act as my guardian in a joint business venture that we will operate together. After praying, my mind asked me to go ahead and contact you for this partnership. My name is PRINCE HASSAN SULEMAN, the only son of Late ALHAJI USMAN SULEMAN. My mother died on the 22nd of October, 1985 of cancer and my father was  assassinated on the 28th of April 2003 by an unknown person in Abidjan, Cote dIvoire. My father was a gold and cocoa merchant based in Ghana/Cote dIvoire.Breifly before he died in a hospital here in Abidjan, Cote dIvoire due to injuries he sustained from the gunshots. He told me about the sum of US$45M(Forty Five Million United States Dollars) belonging to him in a suspense account with one of our local Bank here in Abidjan, Cote dIvoire. That he willed the money to me in his will, with his attorney. He asked me to seek for a foreign partner Who will assist me in transferring the money out of Abidjan, CotedIvoire to a foreign account for investment purpose. Then help me make arrangement after the transfer to leave this country. That those people that killed him may be after me. According to my late fathers will, the money cannot be released to me without a foreign partner until at the age of 37 years. It can only be transferred from the Bank here to the account of my foreign partner  before I attain the age of 37 years. Presently I am 34years old and can not seat here for the next 3years waiting for the maturity date, while my life is in danger. This is my reason for contacting you to assist me present your self as my foreign partner and also provide foreign account where this fund will be transferred to.I have already contacted my fathers attorney here in respect of this transaction. He is waiting to hear from my foreign partner for us to start the process for the transfer of the funds. I would have done this since but according to our tradition. I have to wait till its one year after my fathers death as a mark of respect before embarking on such project. So that it will not look like if I am just after his money like my uncle. Since the death of my father, I have been with my fathers brother in Ghana. Honestly the way he is treating me, make me  to be suspecting him that he knows some thing about my late fathers death.  Based on this, I left his house with out his consent. Presently I am in Abidjan,Cote d Ivoire. He dont know my way about and will never know. This is why I need your assistance so urgent for us to finalise this transaction as soon as possible for me to leave this Country. You will be given 40% as compensation for your assistance and effort before any thing is done with the money. If you are interested and feel that you can handle this project. Please get back to me for more details and as well as indicate your private Tel/Fax numbers where I can always reach you, when the need arises. I await to hear from you. Thanks and God bless.

phishing,legitimate,True,"We can do this  Dear Sir,      I am DR KABO HAMMED     I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, an American oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) deposited for twelve calendar months, valued at US$41,500,000.00 (Forty-one Million, five hundred Thousand Dollars) in my branch upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract  employers, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident  with his family along Benin/Shagamu Express Way. On  further investigation, I found out that he did not  leave a WILL and allattempts to trace his next of kin  were fruitless.      I therefore made further investigation and discovered  that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any next of kin n all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork. This sum of US$41,500,000.00 is still sitting in the Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will come forward to claim it.  According to the Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.      Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Barry Kelly so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide me immediately with your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents  and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin.   We shall employ the services of two attorneys for drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world, which you provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you.      There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via email. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you Understand. please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.

phishing,legitimate,True,"how 's it going ? hello friend , my name is carl simmons . in october 1988 , i received this bulletin in the mail . naturally i was skeptical , but i decided to try it because i was heavily in debt at the time . i had everything to gain and nothing to lose . even if this program worked only a fraction of what the example showed , i would be a success ! well , i m adding this note here to tell you it does work ! i will never forget how it happened . i followed the instructions exactly . the total cost was about $ 46 . 00 including postage . i dropped the envelopes off a the post office on my way to work one day in late october hoping to earn a few dollars to buy christmas presents . the recipe i ordered from the person in the # 1 position came in about a week . i did not think much about it after that until a few weeks later when my boss told me my wife had called and i was needed at home immediately due to some emergency . i raced home in a panic , threw the apartment door open , and what a sight i saw ! my wife was standing over a pile of envelopes that the mailman had dumped on the living room floor from two big canvas bags . we spend the rest of the day and most of the night opening and counting 3 , 245 envelopes , each containing $ 2 . 00 and a self-addressed stamped envelope . the next day we received 4 , 274 more . by the time the orders stopped coming in , about two weeks later , i had received $ 92 , 428 . 00 in cash ! ( i wonder what the printer though when i had him print 46 , 000 copies of the recipes in one week ! ) needless to say , i immediately quit my job , paid off al my debts in full and started another mailing . to date my revenues are approaching $ 1 , 000 , 000 . 00 in cold hard cash . believe me , you can do the same thing . this is you lucky break that you have been hoping for all your life . you can make your dreams come true . . . do not pass it up ! the most difficult part was finding a good company to provide responsive names . after trying many name sources , i ran across two companies that provided the best names for this program . their addresses and prices are below : mjg advertising 200 names $ 24 . 00 p . o . box 3009 500 names $ 35 . 00 maple glen , pa 19002 1000 names $ 50 . 00 ( 215 ) 643-1328 2000 names $ 75 . 00 ( 800 ) 880-8143 marnico lists 200 names $ 20 . 00 p . o . box 2046 500 names $ 35 . 00 abington , ma 02351 1000 names $ 60 . 00 request # 3001 2000 names $ 95 . 00 making your fortune is as easy as following these six steps : 1 . send a self addressed stamped envelope and $ 2 . 00 cash wrapped in a sheet of paper specifying which recipe you are ordering by number , to addresses # 1 through # 5 at the end of this bulletin . 2 . order at least 200 names and addresses on labels from the companies mentioned earlier . 3 . while waiting for your labels to arrive , remove the name at the # 1 spot and move each of the names up one position . place your name and address in spot # 5 . move only the names and addresses - not the recipes . this can best be done by retyping the set and pasting the new over the original . 4 . have a local printshop print at least 200 copies of this bulletin . 5 . fold the printed bulletins and place in envelopes , seal and stamp them . 6 . when the labels arrive , place one on each envelope and mail them . now here s the best part - the money you can make ! here is what happens when only 10 % of the people respond to your mailing . you send out at least 200 with your name in position # 5 . 20 people send out at least 200 with your name in position # 4 . 400 people send out at least 200 with your name in position # 3 . 8000 people send out at least 200 with your name in position # 2 . 160000 people send out at least 200 with your name in position # 1 . 168420 x $ 2 . 00 each = $ 336840 in about 60 to 90 days ! ! ! of course you are not limited to mailing only 200 bulletins , or to just one mailing . send out more than 250 or do repeat mailings and you will drastically increase your earnings . when you receive 1 , 000 requests for recipe # 3 , sit back and relax knowing that you re soon going to be a very rich person . yes , this is a perfectly legal mail order marketing plan . if you are in doubt , then refer to title 18 , section 1302 and 1341 of the u . s . postal and lottery laws . a product or service must be exchanged for the money received ; in this case , the product is the recipes . this plan also takes honest work , but the rewards are tremendous . keep a careful account of all money you received and money you spend for income tax purposes . there you have it ! the secret to making thousands for yourself . read this bulletin carefully and then reread it again . think about it , do the math and consider the wealth potential this holds for you . then send $ 2 . 00 cash and a self-addressed stamped envelope today to the addresses in positions # 1 below . go for it , order those recipes today . 1 . chocolate cream pie 2 . pineapple bavarian pudding henry w . frye , sr . harold lookwood 24684 atwood ave . 123 skokorat st . moreno valley , ca 92553 seymour , ct . 06483 3 . chocolate walnut cookies 4 . cheese garlic biscuits vincent myers , jr . dlh enterprises inc . 848 n . rainbow , # 351 p . o . box 5854 las vegas , nv 89107 san jose , ca 95150 5 . magic cookies bar acw enterprises p . o . box 3004-332 corvallis , or 97333 i tried a similar program in which the cost was $ 5 . 00 . in that one , the response was only about 3 % . the first time i sent out this recipe program a got my first responses in just one week . i sent out 250 letters instead of just 100 so my percentage of gains was higher . i am trying again with 500 letters to see if i can surpass the $ 141 , 236 . 00 of the last time . good luck to all of you . it really works ! ! ! sally freisch , st louis , il",1

legitimate,phishing,True,"[sugar] Fwd: OLPC Nepal looking for Volunteers for this Summer ---------- Forwarded message ---------- From: Bryan Berry  Date: May 3, 2007 6:54 AM Subject: OLPC Nepal looking for Volunteers for this Summer To: devel@laptop.org, games@laptop.org, olpc-open@laptop.org   from: http://olpcnepal.blogspot.com/2007/05/were-looking-for-volunteers-for-this.html  As you may read in the previous Post "" An Amazing Educator,"" a fantastic educator has joined our group. We are looking to work with her very intensely this summer to implement many of her existing learning activities and add as many cool activities as we can. In the fall we plan to visit many, many schools to figure out how kids and teachers react to these materials.  Right now we have three full-time volunteer developers, all of them Nepali. We would love four (4) foreign volunteers to come work with us this summer in Kathmandu. We will pair each foreign volunteer with a Nepali intern. That should bring our content strike force to 11 people. That would really help us to advance OLPC in Nepal.  Requirements: We are looking for experienced programmers. Your age and # of university degrees are less important to us than your passion for software development. We seek individuals with significant software development experience on Linux, ideally in Python, PyGames, C, etc. You should have already run the OLPC image in an emulator.  You should expect to stay in Nepal for a minimum of 6 weeks. You can stay a maximum of 5 months due to Nepal's complex visa rules. If your application is selected, you can start as soon as you can get here.  Compensation: We are prepared to offer a generous salary package of $0 per month, reimburse you for a full 0% of your airplane ticket cost, and offer no health plan. We don't have any $ :) Our office, bandwidth, and computers have all been donated. We can offer comfortable lodging for a total of four volunteers. We can accept additional volunteers if they are willing to find and pay for their own accommodation.  We can offer you an opportunity to work w/ a very passionate team of engineers on one of the most exciting projects in the world. If you are interested please send an e-mail with your C.V. and a brief description of what you have done w/ OLPC so far to bryan at olpcnepal dot org  Unfortunately, summer is monsoon season so Nepal aweseome trekking isn't a good idea. Still, it's been a weird year weather-wise. We'll try to get you out for a trek near the end of the summer.  We'll take you running/hiking in the hills surrounding Kathmandu if you are so inclined and subject you to Ankur's bad jokes (and they are very bad).  The Work: You will work closely with our lead developers Shankar, Ankur, and Himali Kiran and our lead educator Christine Stone. You will help implement a series of activities based on PyGame and/or GCompris. That means writing a lot of Python, possibly some C, working with sound libraries, and more. If you have some exciting ideas for power management or mesh networking, we may find some time to work on them w/ you. However, you should expect to spend most of your time building Sugar activities, getting feedback from Christine, revising, showing to kids and teachers, repeat.  We will expect you to train the Nepali intern assigned to you. The intern will most likely be an undergraduate computer science student.  The development team will frequently interact with kids and teachers over the course of the summer.  We intend to recruit education volunteers at a later date. I'll save that for a future blog entry.  --  Bryan W.

phishing,legitimate,True,"business Dear Sir/Madam,  I am contacting you on a transfer of a huge sum. of money from a deseased. Though I know that a  transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day.  Introduction:  My name is Mr. Keykhosrow Sobhe and l am the Solicitor to Mr. Robert who died on a plane crash with his entire family on the 11th of September 2001 along side other passengers in flight 175. from Boston, Massachusetts to Los Angeles California, it was the second hijacked plane to strike the World. Trade Center plugging into the South Tower. Two pilots and seven flight attendants and fifty-seven(57) passengers were on board.  Since Mr. Roberts death, there has not been any application to claim his money by a next-of-kin as his wife who was supposed to be his next-of-kin died along side with my late client in the same accident. After 4 years of dormancy any such accounts holding funds of certain magnitudes will be re-directed to the bank treasury as unclaimed funds  and will be shared among the bank share holders. After which the file will  be closed. This is what I am trying to prevent from happening. I will rather see the whole money go directly to charity organization with a help of a foreigner.  If you share the same ideology as myself, please do not hesitate to contact me. However, it may interest you to know that we have secured from probate  and order of mandamus to locate any of the diseased surviving next-of-kin. upon this discovery. I now seek your permission to have you stand as a next-of-kin to the deceased.  All documentation will be carefully worked out by me for the funds to be released into your favor as the beneficiary's next-of-kin.  NOTE: THE REASON WHY I AM DOING THIS IS THAT, I WOULD RATHER SEE THE WHOLE AMOUNT GO DIRECTLY TO CHARITY, THAN HAVE THOSE BANK DIRECTORS AND SHARE HOLDERS HAVE IT IN THEIR PERSONAL BANK ACCOUNTS.  IT IS ALSO A LIFE TIME OPPORTUNITY FOR ME AND HOPEFULLY YOU AS WELL. Please acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual business endeavor by furnishing me with the following information bellow.  1. YOUR FULL NAME/ADDRESS;  2. YOUR COMPANY NAME; 3.

Company Name: Yukon Go|d Corporation, Inc Symbo|: YGDC  Shares Outstanding: Approx. 9.8 mil|ion  Currently trading at: $ 1.00  Major Breaking news!   Yukon Gold Corporation, Inc. Acquires Bil|iOn DO|lar Polymeta|lic  Inground Resource in Canadas Pro|ific Tombstone Go|d Belt, Yukon Territory  Press Release Source: Yukon Gold Corporation, Inc.  Toronto, Canada, March O7, 2005. Yukon Go|d Corporation, Inc. (Yukon  Go|d), (YGDC) announced today that it has acquired the Marg  Deposit, a 20,O0O acre, volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS)  property,  located in the centra| Yukon Territory.  Marg Deposit Mineral Resource Estimate:  Based on a 1997 ore resource study by Franzen Minera| Engineering Ltd.,  the Marg Deposit has a dri|l indicated resource of 6,1OO,0OO tons  grading 1.76% copper, 4.60% zinc, 2.46% lead, 62.7 g. of silver per ton  and  0.98 g. of go|d per ton over an average true width of 6.1 metres (20  ft.). Open a|ong strike in both directions and down dip, the Company  believes this c|assic base meta| deposit has the major potential for  substantia||y increasing tonnage.  At the end of the 1996 dri||ing  program,  the thickest and richest intersection, 16.2 metre (53 ft.) true width  averaged 2.82% copper, 2.46% lead, 5.5O% zinc, 82.5 g of si|ver and  1.84  g. of go|d per ton.  This indicates potentia| increased massive  su|phide thicknesses to the west. Based on current meta| prices, the  in-ground  va|ue of the Marg resource without any further exp|oration is just over  1 Bi||i0n d0|lars. (*)(**) A preliminary evaluation by Yukon Golds  engineers  and geologists have determined this outcropping deposit with its  favorab|e topography, resource base and excel|ent exploration  potentia|, will  warrant proceeding to production.  (*) Dollar Figure in Canadian (**)Tota| in-ground resources and current va|ues based on US Copper   $1.50 lb, Lead  $0.45 lb, Zinc  $0.62 |b, Silver  $7.29 oz., Go|d   $432.OO oz. as  of February 23, 2005, Exchange rate O.8O.

I know my mail might be a surprise to you but never mind because I am contacting you in good faith. There are certain times in ones life that whether or not one indicates interest for certain assignment, people would look up to him/her for assistance.        I'm Miss Naomi stephane, a 23year old ophan from the Republic of Zimbabwe.        During the current crisis against the farmers of Zimbabwe by the supporters of President Robert Mugabe to claim all the white owned farms in our country, he ordered all the white farmers to surrender their farms to his party members and their followers. My father however was one of the best farmers in the country, hence the supporters invaded my father's farm and burnt down everything, killed him and confiscated his properties (i've earlier lost my mom in my teen). So, after the tragic incident i decided to relocate to Cote d'ivoire (where dad told me he has money saved in a reserve company) for safety.        Before dad actually gave up in the hospital, he told me that  he deposited the sum of $5,200,000,( five million two hundred thousand dollars) in a private security(reserve) company as family valuable property in a trunk box for safekeeping of the fund.    He also gave me the documents which was given to him when the money was deposited.      The following are the documents:  (i)Certificate of deposit                   (ii)Agreement of deposit          (iii)Receipt of deposit payment.          Dad told me while on his dying bed to tranfer the money abroad in an enabling enviroment and use it for profitable adventures.         Please, I want you to know also that this money is the only hope we have for our future survival as our greedy relative made do with whatever remains of the party supporters loot except this fund which they're not aware of.            However, at present there's political uprising in the country where we are and the Northern Region has been seized by a separatist rebelious group that are also causing disturbanses in the commecial capital where i live at present.        My purpose of contacting you is for you to help me retrieve the fund and provide a bank account abroad (in your place) where i will transfer my inheritted fund and assist me to come over to your place and use it for profitable ventures in partnership with you.  Though you will be the initial manager since i'm more interested in completing my education which has been interrupted by my fathers demise.         Based on the experience i suppose you possess living in a developed economy, I believe with that esteem knowledge in the business world my money will be properly channeled in a viable/profitable business venture.            I am willing to offer you 20% of the total sum if you will assist me in good faith.

Before I proceed further let me introduce myself, my name is Mr william okafor and I  am part of a group of five government officials still in active government service in different government parastatals, collectively we are members a special commitee formed by the present democratic government .The purpose of this commitee is to monitor the privatisation of some government parastals of which the Nigerian Electric Power Autority (NEPA) is one of such parastals.  We have sucessfully amassed the sum of Twenty Three Million United State Dollars ($23million) for ourselves which was accrued as a result of over-invoiced reciepts from sales of shares of other government parastals. We intend to transfer this fund out of this country to a foreign offshore account, but being that we are still in active government service, we are not allowed to transfer any money or own foreign accounts.  Inlight of this we have decided to solicit for your assistance in the provision of a foreign account where we can transfer this fund to. For your assistance we have agreed to give you 20% of the total fund, which is  Four Million, Six Hundred Thousand United States Dollars($4.6million), 70% will come to I and my colleagues and the balance 10% has been set aside for any expense incurred in the process of this mutually beneficial transaction.

I would appreciate comments from anyone, pro or > con, with knowledge and experience of these things, however, as I'm rather > limited on both.  I agree - it's never a good idea to use the same data for creating your classifier and determining it's effectiveness (I meant to say ""pick the one with the lowest error rate on your TEST data"").  The reason to choose from many random starts is that fitting a given neural network _model_ (ie. input x, n nodes, ...) is very hard due to the large overparameterisation of the problem space.  For example, the parameters for one node in a given layer can be exchanged with the parameters of another node (as well as the parameters that use those nodes in next layer), without changing the overall model.  This makes it very hard to optimise, and nnet in R often gets stuck in local minima. Looking at what individual nodes are doing, you often see examples where some nodes contribute nothing to the overall classification. The random starts aren't to find different models but to find the parameters for the given model that fits best.  And following this line of argument, you would probably want to use the internal criterion value, rather than some external measure of accuracy.  > The simple answer to the question of obtaining the error rate using > validation data is: Do whatever you like to choose/fit a classifier on the > training set. **Once you are done,** the estimate of your error rate is the > error rate you get on applying that classifier to the validation set.

You need yet new validation data for that.  Understanding that that estimate is biased is important, but in practice, do people really care that much?  If you have looked at a single plot of your data and used that to inform your choice of the classifier your estimates will already be biased (but if you have used other knowledge of the data or subject area, you might expect them to be biased in a positive direction). Are the estimates of model really the most important thing?  Surely an understanding of the problem/data is what you are really trying to gain.

""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stret! ch! . Trent Dilfer , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point. Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 10/23/01 Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck fr! om! a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week. Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 10/23/01 The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams. Dedric Ward , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season. Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Neal/McKay Updated 10/23/01 Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week. Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week. Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Tori U! pd! ated 10/23/01 Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use him this week. Terrence Wilkins , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week. Terrell Davis , RB DEN - JWillie Updated 10/23/01 Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they will activate h! im! . He will work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Martin Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice until late in the week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota.  Duce Staley , RB PHI - Giggles Updated 10/23/01 Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on 11 carries l! at! e in the game. At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a solid replacement.  Joe Nedney , K TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week.  Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Kinney will be listed on the injury report because of a calf injury. However, he is expected to play in this week's game.  Kevin Dyson , WR TEN - Bass/Hull Updated 10/23/01 Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice. Eddie George , RB TEN - Tori Updated 10/23/01 George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in this week's game.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Martin Updated 10/23/01 McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game.  Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence.  Damon Jones , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery.  Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Martin Updated 10/23/01 Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's game remains uncertain. ""All I know is that, from week to week, they increase his exercises and change of direction,"" head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. ""It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week."" Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23.  Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to action next week.  Todd Heap , TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle.  Terry Allen , RB BAL - Tori Updated 10/23/01 Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at running back if Allen is inactive.  Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Tori Updated 10/23/01 Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. ""I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest area,"" Grbac said Monday. ""There could be something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see."" Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unable to play.  Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Neal/McKay Updated 10/23/01 Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orleans.  Trung Canidate , RB STL - Giggles Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. ""I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game,"" coach Mike Martz said. ""He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play."" Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week.  J.J. Stokes , WR SF - Matty Updated 10/23/01 Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close to being completely healthy. ""Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was a blessing for me because I was ab! le! to get treatment every day,"" Stokes told the Contra Costa Times . ""I practiced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close."" Stokes has been less than mediocre, however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to be more reliable.  Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - Russell Updated 10/23/01 Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants' starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed.  Ron Dixon , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day.  Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Matty Updated 10/23/01 According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. ""I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago,"" Martz said. ""I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play."" Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to go.

I am from Dubai . I have been diagnosed with   Esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right   now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. I   have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for   anyone (not even myself)but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never   generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as   that was the only thing I cared for.     But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just   wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives   me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different   way from how I have lived it.     Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and   assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as few close   friends .I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have   decided to give alms to charity organizations and those in Need, as I want   this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth.     So far, I have Distributed money to some charity organizations when I was   well. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself   anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and   distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in United   States, Asia, Middle East & Europe, they refused and kept the money to   themselves.     Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with   what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the   huge cash deposit of ten Million United States Dollars ($10, 000,   000.00) that I have with an Asset Management / Vaulting Company Abroad. I   will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatch it to charity   organizations and use it to help those in Need.     N/B:Kindly note that 40% of this funds must go to victims of Tsunami,   Hurricane Katrina , Hurricane Wilma and South Asia Earthquake , 55% to other   Charity Organizations around the World and 5% for your effort and time.

I am Mr.Cheung Pui,director of operations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd,Sai Wan Ho Branch.I have a business proposal for you.  Before the U.S and Iraqi war,our client Major Fadi Basem who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war early this year. Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the Major and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.  After further investigation it was also discovered that Major Fadi Basem did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Twenty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the  laws of my country at the expiration 3 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem so that you will be able to receive his funds.   WHAT IS TO BE DONE:  I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary documents that will back you up as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem,all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the transfer of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.  There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue.Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me,25%for you,and 5% for any expenses incurred during the course of the operation. Should you be interested please send me your full names and current residential address and I will prefer you to reach me on the email address: cheung_pui1@hotmail.ro  Once i get your response to co-operate,i shall provide you with more details of this operation.

The terror attacks on the United States on September 11, 20O1 have  changed the security landscape for the foreseeable future. Both  physical  and logical security have become paramount for all industry segments,  especially in the banking, healthcare and government sectors. While the  focus for Vinoble is on North America, the opportunity for security  services is worldwide. According to Giga, a wholly owned subsidiary of  Forrester Research, worldwide demand for information security products  and  services is set to eclipse $46B by 2O05.  Vinoble intends to capitalize on the dramatic growth in the security  market by delivering professional services, security products, security  training, and managed security services. In pursuit of this objective,  Vinoble has assembled a highly qualified team of security professionals  offering a full range of security services. Through Vinoble's  consulting services and integrated delivery solutions, Vinoble will  help  organizations protect key assets including persons, property,  information,  brand, and reputation.   Homeland Security, the National Strategy for a Secure Cyberspace, the  Healthcare Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA),  Sarbanes-Oxley and other regulatory programs will all cause a continued  increase in security demands in the United States and abroad. Vinoble  intends  to position itself as the 'most desired' provider of, both, physical  and information security solutions - in the eyes of our clients,  alliance  partners, and peers. We will accomplish this by ensuring our teams are  the most knowledgeable, agile, professional, and cost-conscious  provider of 'tailored' security solutions to meet the unique needs of  each  client.  Management has partnered with GarcyCo Capital Corp. (""GCCC"") to assist  in finding acquisition candidates for the company, structuring such  acquisitions, and effecting a transition to corporate growth. At  present,  Vinoble and GCCC have targeted several companies as potential  acquisition candidates. Pending the outcome of due diligence and  audits, the  company believes the acquisition of these assets will provide the basis  required for listing on a national exchange.    HERE IS RECENT NEWS ON THE COMPANY:  MALIBU, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 2O, 2O05--Vinoble, Inc. (OTCBB:  VNBL - News), a holding company seeking to identify long-term growth  opportunities in the areas of homeland security, security information  systems, and other security services, is pleased to announce that as it  continues in its efforts to reach definitive agreements on the acquisition  of assets, businesses, and strategic partners in the RFID and GPS  tracking sector, Vinoble has further engaged with several additional  businesses and individuals for the purpose of acquiring technology, software,  and patents.   Following the move to acquire RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)  technology, hardware and patents for the sole purpose of specific use  applications, the Company has concluded that the need for application  support software or middleware is part of the fundamental component of the  framework which operates such technology. The Company has identified  several sources for both licensing and the acquisition of such software,  and has begun to pursue discussions to access this important element.   Middleware is used primarily to link disparate applications, both  internally and externally, to the enterprise. This typically involves  routing data using different transport protocols, translating data into  different formats and providing a suitable means of integration such as Web  services and service-oriented architectures.   Since RFID is an integral part in the tracking of both mobile and  non-mobile assets, user-friendly and efficient management software enabling  customers to manage RFID data both incoming and out-bound is important  in maintaining customer loyalty and reduces costs associated with  customer service. Management software will allow for real time visibility of  assets or product inventory, whether in transit, in a warehouse, at the  manufacturing plant, or on a store shelf. Visibility and accuracy will  enable customers to reduce handling costs, gain instant access to  shipment information and increase inventory flow throughout the supply  chain. The ability to manage data collection from a number of different RFID  and GPS devices is essential for proper efficiency of the system.   The Company believes that such acquisition of middleware technology  will be essential and will further position Vinoble in the vastly growing  RFID and GPS tracking industry. The Company's goal is to provide  critical security services at a cost manageable to even the smallest of  businesses that can't afford to do without the safety of their personnel and  assets in this current state of constant threat.

legitimate,phishing,True,"No Confidence in Congress Lou Dobbs Tonight Thursday, June 21, 2007  Tonight, a new Gallup poll reveals only 14 percent of Americans have confidence in the United States Congress. This poll comes on the heels of several others showing Congressional and Presidential approval ratings at the lowest level in years. What in the world is going on in Washington, and what can we do about it? We'll ask and asnwer those questions tonight.  More than 15 million children are at risk of dropping out of our nations schools, according to the Office of Juvenile Justice Department. With already more than a million students not lining up to graduate this year, there is a new outcry for parental involvement in childrens lives. Studies list parental involvement as key when it comes to combating dropout rates. Well have a full report tonight.  Illegal aliens are now taking extreme measures to cross our southern border, including starting fires near observation towers. The Border Patrol says apprehensions are down, but are these new diversion tactics to blame? We'll have a special report.  Senators Ted Kennedy and Dianne Feinstein held a press conference today touting the importance of a provision for illegal alien agricultural workers in the Senates immigration reform bill.  Meanwhile Senators Jim DeMint, Chuck Grassley and David Vitter are held a press conference discussing why the Senates so-called grand compromise will only repeat the failures of the past. Well report on the battle to get the bill back out on the floor.  And well take a look at the latest developments towards the creation of a North American Union between the United States, Mexico and Canada.  We'll also discuss the Senate's grand compromise on immigration with Senator Claire McCaskill. The Senator says we will never get a handle on illegal immigration until we hold employers accountable.  Visit http://cnn.com/loudobbstonight to read Lous latest commentary on a legacy in search of a president: More than 1.2 million students will not graduate public high school this year. Somebody needs to fix our broken education system in this country. Will the president assert real leadership on this issue?  Lou Dobbs lays out his manifesto to save the middle class in his new book, War on the Middle Class: How the Government, Big Business, and Special Interest Groups Are Waging War on the American Dream and How to Fight Back.

I have to say that I have no intentions of causing you any  Pains so I decided to contact you through this medium. As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I believe I really caused all that have happened to me of late.  My name is Prince Desmond Hasen, a merchant in Nepal. I am originally  From Norway. I have been diagnosed with prostate cancer that was discovered very late due to my laxity in caring for my health. It has defiled all form of medicine and right now, I have only about a few months to live according to medical experts.  I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared  For anyone not even myself but my business. The most devastating aspect of the whole thing is losing my only surviving brother, Mr. Asbjorn Hasen, to the Tsunami while holidaying in Phuket, Thailand on the 26th of December 2004. Now that I know my time is up and there is no relative to which I can will my wealth to, I have decided to will and give most of my properties and assets to charity and 25% of this funds must go to charities for family of the Tsunami victims.  Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self. I once asked a friend of mine to close one of my accounts and donate  the money, which I have there to a Motherless Babies Home in India; I late found that he kept the money to himself. This has destroyed my faith in him as he seems not to be contended with what I have done for him. I have some money which is being held with a financial firm abroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and share it to charity organizations.  I am writing this from my laptop computer in my house in Katmandu Nepal where I have a customize hospital bed on which I lay waiting for my  time to come. I pray that God uses you to support and assist me achieve my last wish on earth.  You can reach me urgently. May the almighty God be with you,  Desmond Hasen",1

He had a closingbalance worth 11,550,000.00 (Eleven Million FiveHundred and Fifty Thousand British Pounds Sterling)with a bank in my country (United Kingdom). Since thetragic incident involving late Bob Williams and hiswife, the bank has waited for close to six years for anext of kin as beneficiary with no success.Valuable efforts have been made by the bank'smanagement and myself to get in touch with any of hisDirect or Extended family Members but I personallyfound out that he died with his wife. Since it is the Law in Great Britain that at theexpiration of Seven (7) years, such funds will bemarked unclaimable and reverted to the ownership ofthe British Government if nobody applies to claim thefunds.

Seven Republicans voted against the proposal, while three Democrats voted in favor. Rep. Johnson (R-Conn.) says the bill, sponsored by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Thomas (R-Calif.), would put $9 billion into state coffers within 10 days of enactment.  The bill would allow states to use the funds to pay regular unemployment benefits, increase benefit payments, extend benefits beyond 26 weeks, expand benefit eligibility, or for administrative purposes. The bill also would extend the work opportunity tax credit and the welfare-to-work tax credit through Dec. 31, 2003, and contains provisions to boost the Social Services Block Grant program by $3 billion so that states can give health coverage to the unemployed. Critics of the bill--including congressional Democrats, labor, and civil rights groups--claim the measure will not accomplish the Republicans' stated goals of stimulating the economy and getting displaced workers back on the job. A substitute measure offered by House Democrats is rejected by a vote of 261-166. Senate Majority Leader Daschle (D-S.D.) tells reporters that he hopes the Senate will be able to pass its own version of an economic stimulus bill before Thanksgiving. . . .

First Unum Life Ins. Co., ""Ark., No. 00-1430, 10/18/01). Reversing summary judgment for First Unum Life Insurance Co., the supreme court holds that because both the insurer and James Elam submitted evidence outside of the insurance policy to support their interpretations of the term ""mental illness,"" the issue is a question of fact for a jury to decide. The policy defines mental illness as ""mental, nervous or emotional diseases or disorders of any type."" Arguing the term is ambiguous, Elam says bipolar affective disorder is a physical illness with a biological origin that is treated with medication. . . . Page A-1 http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/dlr.nsf/id/a0a4w6a7e7_ SIXTH CIRCUIT BLOCKS MOVE TO SEPARATE FLSA, LMRA CLAIMS A former truck driver's attempt to separate claims he brought under the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Labor-Management Relations Act in order to avail himself of the FLSA's two-year statute of limitations falls short, as the Sixth Circuit finds the wage claim barred by the federal labor law's six-month limitations period (""Martin v. Lake County Sewer Co., ""6th Cir., No. 00-00228, 10/17/01). In addition to seeking unpaid wages under the FLSA after his discharge, Donald Martin charged his former employer, Lake County Sewer Co., with violating the terms of its collective bargaining agreement with a Teamsters local in violation of LMRA Section 301. Martin also contended that the union violated its duty of fair representation under Section 301 by failing to pursue a grievance against Lake for allegedly improper deductions in his benefits and pay. Martin argues his FLSA claim is distinct from the Section 301 claim and therefore governed by the wage law's two-year limitations period. According to the Sixth Circuit, however, Martin's charge relating to the unpaid wages was based on the provision in the collective bargaining agreement governing compensation and must be resolved in accordance with LMRA procedures. . . .

Ulster County, ""N.D. N.Y., No. 99-CV-1278, 10/10/01). Rejecting a summary judgment motion by Ulster County Golden Hill Health Care Center, Judge Homer of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York finds that Gail Becker established enough evidence to go to trial on her claims of sexual harassment based on a hostile work environment and retaliation under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and other laws. Her evidence surrounding the assault incident--including her supervisor's failure to allow Becker to call the police and the facility's refusal to allow her time off to seek a protective order--if credited, ""establishes an incident sufficient by itself to support a finding that the conditions of her employment were irrevocably altered as a result and that those conditions became abusive,"" the court holds. . . .

Business activity recovered quickly from some aspects of the attacks, such as reduced air cargo capacity, but long-run effects are more difficult to assess, according to the Fed. New since the attacks, however, are disruptions to productivity due to increased security precautions and insurance premiums, the central bank says. . . .

phishing,legitimate,True,"(Peace) Dear Sir/Madam  At this perceived confusion or stress may have With due respect. Sorry receiving this letter Since we have not known ourselves or met before.  Despite that, I am constrained to write you this letter because of the urgency of it.   By way of self introduction, I am Mrs Joy Afolabi, the wife of late Dr. Sunday Afolabi Little did I know that my Late husband used his position in the present government to influence the  Nigerian government to award SAGEM S.A COMPANY (FRANCE)  the contract of handing the Nigerian national identification card scheme in Nigeria of, which he and his colleagues were then offered the sum of $214 million dollars by SAGEM as bribes.  Since my husband was a care-free person, he was poisoned by his colleagues so that he will not get his share of the deal and later died out of shock during his treatment abroad in Germany when he Finlay realised that his case was as a result of poison, but thank God, my husband was smart enough to have kept some wealth without letting anybody knows about it.   However, since after my husband death, we have suffered maltreatment and untold hardship in the hands of my late husband's family, simply because I did not bear a male child [heir apparent] for my late husband. By tradition, all that my late husband had, [wealth] belongs to his brothers/family. And myself is to be remarried by his immediate younger brother which I vehemently refused. They have taken all that I suffered with my husband to acquire including treasures, houses and his bank particular seized by them. I wanted to escape to the United States of America [USA} with my children on exile, but again they conspired and stole my International passport and  other travelling document to further frustrate me. My three daughters and I are trapped in obnoxious custom and traditional norms.   Thank God, two weeks ago, I received Key Text Code from a Security Company in EUROPE, that my late husband deposited U.S $15.5 Million cash in one Security company in Europe. It has therefore become very necessary and urgent to contact someone a foreigner like you to help me receive/secure these funds overseas in a  reliable bank Account presumably an empty Bank Account, if available and  to help invest it on our behalf as well, while we find a way of getting out to meet with you in your country. These funds are kept with one Security Company in EUROPE to avoid detection, seizure or diversion.   I have had several communication with  the Director of the security company in Europe, who has express willingness to help me on meeting the company's demands.  This is why I have contacted you to help save my children and I By receiving these funds on our behalf. But you need to give me Sufficient assurance that you will not divert the fund if you help me.    My children and I have resolved to give you 30% of the total sum. This is all my children and I have got to live on.    Please, I have reposed my confidence in you and hope you will not disappoint me. I look forward to your urgent response, including your phone/ mobile No and also your fax no for easier communication. The secret codes (e.g Pin No, Secret Access Code)for this fund are safely kept with me which I can give you as soon as you express desire to help me.  Thank in advance for confidentiality and I look forward to hearing from you.  Mrs. Joy Afolabi.

phishing,legitimate,True,"CONFIDENTIAL DR.TUNJI OWO Zenith Bank Ltd,Lagos,Nigeria, Private Tel:234-80-2354-6330.  Dear Friend, I am DR.TUNJI OWO.The Manager Zenith Bank, Lagos, Nigeria.  I have urgent and-ery confidential business proposition for you. On April 6, 1996, a Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr.Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for some months, valued at S$29,500,000.00 (Twenty Nine Million Five hundred Thousand Dollars only) in my branch. Upon maturity,I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month,we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers,the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Barry Kelly died on 1 February 1997 in a plane crash on air senegal on aircraft Name Hawker Siddeley HS-748. This crash happened in Tambacoumba, Senegal, Africa and the registration  number of the aircraft is 6AV-AEO, and since his untimely death the funds has been dormant in his account with my Bank without any claim of the fund On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$29,500,000.00 has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for safe-keeping.No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law,at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as an Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money I deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes though the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as I tagged them to be photographic materials for export.   am writing you because I as a public servant, we can not operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than $1m.I want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney.All these are to make sure that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney willprepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the as the owner of the boxes. The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 25% for you and 5% will take care of all expenses.There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantee the successful execution of this transaction. f you are interested, please reply immediately via my email address. upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe with utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. REGARDS. DR.TUNJI OWO.",1

Email:clicfwanton@rixmail.se    Dear Friend,    It is with trust and confidence that I write to reveal this urgent  business relationship to you. I was assigned by two of my colleagues to  seek for a foreign partner who will assist us in providing a convenient  account in a designated bank overseas for the transfer of US$32,000,  000.00 (Thirty Two Million United States Dollars Only) pending our  arrival in your country for utilization and disbursement of the fund  with the owner of the account where the fund would be transferred  into.    On the 23rd of January 1996, our corporation, the Nigeria National  Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) awarded a contract of $120,000,000.00 (  One Hundred and Twenty Million United States Dollars) but I and my  colleagues being members of the contract award committee inflated the  contract sum to the tune of US$152,000, 000.00 with the intention of  sharing the remaining balance of US$32,000,000.00 among ourselves.    The contract has been successfully executed and the actual contractors  have been paid their US$120,000,000.00 ( One Hundred and Twenty Million  United States Dollars) in full. But what we want to transfer out of the  country in our favour for disbursement is US$32M. balance My colleagues  and I have agreed that if you / your company can act as the beneficiary  of this fund , we will transfer the funds to your account and you will  retain 30% of the total fund for assistance rendered, while we will  retain 60% of the total fund and the balance of 10% of the fund will be  set aside for the offsetting of all expenses that might be incurredby  both parties during the fund transfer process.    We request you cooperate with us and provide a convenient account  number in a designated bank where this fund can be safely transferred  to, we intend to come over to your country on the completion of the  fund transfer to secure our own share of the funds.    THE NATURE OF YOUR BUSINESS IS NOT PARTICULARLY RELEVANT FOR THE CCESS  OF THIS TRANS ACTION. ALL WE REQUIRE IS YOUR WELLINGNESS TO CO-OPERATE  AND ASSURANCE THAT OUR OWN SHARE WILL BE GIVEN TO US WHEN THIS MONEY IS  TRANSFERRED INTO YOUR ACCOUNT.ALL NECESSARY PRECAUTIONS HAVE BEEN TAKEN  TO TO ENSURE A NO RISK SITUATION ON THE SIDE OF BOTHPARTIES AND IT IS  BELIEVED THAT THIS TRANSACTION WILL LAST 20 WORKING DAYS, BARRING ANY  DELAYS. SINCE WE HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF BUSINESS, OUR PLAN IS TO INVEST  THIS MONEY INTO REAL ESTATE, STOCK AND PERHAPS IMPORTATION OF GOODS  FROM YOUR COUNTRY BASED ON YOUR ADVISE BECAUSE MANY OF OUR YEARS HAS  BEEN SPENT AS CIVIL SERVANT,AND WE MAY LIKELY RESIGN FROM GOVERMENT  SERVICE TO PRIVATE BUSINESS AFTER THIS MONEY IS TRANFERED INTO YOUR  ACCOUNT.

phishing,legitimate,True,"REPLY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE   MR. MING YANG HANG SENG BANK LTD. 83, Des Voeux Road., Central HK, Hong Kong. mingyang_h@yahoo.com.hk  Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Ming Yang director of operations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd. I have an obscured business suggestion for you.  Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client Gen. Aadel Akgaal Bastaan  who was with the Iraqi forces and also businessman made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several notices was sent to him, even during the war which began in 2003. Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the General along with his wife and only daughter had been killed during the war in a bomb blast that hit their home. You can read more about the bombings on visiting these sites below:  1. http://www.ccmep.org/usbombingwatch/2003.htm#3/19/03  2. http://civilians.info/iraq/deaths_data.php   After further investigation it was also discovered that Gen. Aadel Akgaal Bastaan  did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Twenty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the laws of my country at the expiration 3 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Gen. Aadel Akgaal Bastaan  so that you will be able to receive his funds.  WHAT IS TO BE DONE:  I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Gen. Aadel Akgaal Bastaan, all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favour for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.  There is no risk involved at all in this matter, as we are going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue. Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall then share in the ratio of 70% for me, 30% for you. Should you be interested please send me your full names, private phone/fax and current residential address and I will prefer you reach me on my private email address below: mingyang_h@yahoo.com.hk and finally after that I shall provide you with more details of this operation.  Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.

phishing,legitimate,True,"A PROPOSITION IT IS URGENT RESPOND PLEASE FROM THE DESK OF:DR.STEPHAN MULLER CITIBANK PRIVATKUNDEN AG & CO.KGaA KASERNEN STR.10 40213 DSSELDORF GERMANY. EMAIL.steffanmuller@gmx.net  RESPOND THROUGH MY Alternative email address: steffanmuller@gmx.net  I am MR STEPHAN MULLER, credit officer of Citibank, Dsseldorf,Germany.I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. In June, 1999, a German property consultant and exporter of used cars ,Mr Andreas Schranner made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at DM30,000,000.00(Thirty Million Deutschmark only)which is now 18,000,000.00(Eighteen Million Euro)only in my branch. It was to our utter suprise that we heard of his death, wife and children in an AF4590 plane crash in July 2000. See website below:  On further investigation,I found out that he died without making a WILL, and hitherto, all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. Mr Andreas Schranner was residing at No 1 Rue de Avenida, G.R.A. ouagoudougou, burkina faso, West Africa. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr Andreas Schranner did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of 21,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Laws of Deutschland, at the expiration of 7(seven)years,the money will be declared frozen and forfeited to German Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin or business partner to Mr Andreas Schranner so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not be conficated by the German Government. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address,phone and fax numbers so that i can prepare the necessary documents that will put you in place as the next of kin or business partner. Your role in this transaction is to send an application for claim of the funds to our bank. Then, as top official of the bank, I shall work behind-the-scene to make sure that your application is approved by the management of the bank, and the funds transfered to your nominated bank account. Please note that there is no iota of risks at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done legitimately and with my position as top official of the bank i would ensure a successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately to my email box. Please send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication. You should observe utmost CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECRECY in this transaction, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I will require your assistance to invest my share in your country. I look forward to your prompt response. Thanks and regards. MR STEPHAN MULLER Alternative email address: steffanmuller@gmx.net",1

legitimate,phishing,True,"Re: VmWare -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA1  Thanks, both what you and Alex said is very clear. I assume that once you hit ctrl+g to interact with the vm, you can use normal speakup review keys, and get speech from a serial hardware synth, assuming you correctly redirected the virtual serial port to the machine's physical serial port? Did you use ssh to do the install, because interacting with the vm isn't as simple as I assumed in my previous question, or was it simply because you just wanted to use ssh to do the install, or because you didn't have a physical serial port/hardware synth? Has anyone tried running gnome in a vmware machine running on a windows host? If this is all as straight forward as it sounds, and as good as it sounds, I may not have to worry about gnu/linux compatible hardware, (I.E. modem, wireless card, on-board serial ports, ETC.), and about the warranty if you resize partitions or remove windows, when looking for a new laptop in the future.

legitimate,phishing,True,"RE: Redfield Deliverability Project I would appear to me that there may be some misconceptions here.     Why do we assume that by entering into a financing deal we will be any better off?  I would tell you that to the extent there was any risk in the deal, that we should probably charge someone else about 25-30% as well.     Think about it, 25% is only 15% after tax.   Has some one enumerated the risks and valued them on this deal?   I haven't seen any of that work, if it has been done.           I think I understand the concept proposed and I understand the proposed goal line, return with little or no expense up front.     I would assume that we would be willing to enter into a fixed price service agreement for a number of years?     Is Halliburton willing to take any risks whatsoever?  Alternatively, why don't we go through GSS (Global Strategic Sourcing) to look for a better deal?	  Jim:   Have you looked at this for ideas on the accounting side?    Why can't I do a prepayment of a service contract fee and recognize the expense over the life of the deal?   -----Original Message----- From: 	Waymire, Dave   Sent:	Wednesday, October 17, 2001 9:17 AM To:	Hayslett, Rod; Gilbert, Steve Cc:	Centilli, James Subject:	RE: Redfield Deliverability Project  Rod,  Below is some background on the Redfield Deliverability Project.

The work overs are planned over a 2-3 year period and are expected to have a lasting effect of at least 10 years.  The cost to model and rework these wells is estimated to be $5.73MM.  A test program would be conducted in the first year to determine the feasibility of continuing the program at a cost of $768,000.  If the test program did not prove out the project would be terminated at this point.  The original proposal was to treat the costs of the program as expense as the costs were incurred. Bob Chandler confirmed this accounting treatment.  This would result as Kent has indicated negative EBIT for the first 2-3 years.   As an alternative it was proposed to Halliburton that NNG would enter into a 10 year service agreement with Halliburton to model and rework the wells and provide guidance on proposed well work overs for the Redfield storage field.  Halliburton would agree to perform the test program and if test results indicate that further work overs would be economically feasible would spend an additional $4.96MM on a total of 60 well workovers in the first 3 years of the contract.  NNG currently budgets $300,000 per year for Redfield well maintenance with minimal increase in deliverability. Operations has committed $300,000 per year in well maintenance over the next 5 years to this project for a total of $1.5MM.  Halliburton has not formalized their counter offer, but has indicated that they would require a 25% to 30% return for assuming the financing.  Halliburton indicated that this is a non-standard deal for them and that is the reason for high return requirement.    The objective is to structure the deal as a service agreement either with an Enron Entity who would then contract with Halliburton or some other third party at a more reasonable rate.  Even at an estimated 30% return, preliminary incremental EBIT estimates for the Halliburton service agreement are between $400,000 to $500,000 the first 5 years and  $250,00 to $275,000 for the out years.       -----Original Message----- From: 	Hayslett, Rod   Sent:	Friday, October 12, 2001 7:05 AM To:	Gilbert, Steve Cc:	Waymire, Dave Subject:	RE: Redfield Deliverability Project  Couple of quick comments.    Prepaying as an expense would require coming up with some income to offset, and generally doesn't make economic sense.   An Enron company can't help because it consolidates, and therefore ends up with the same accounting results as we do.       What accountants have reviewed the proposal?   -----Original Message----- From: 	Miller, Kent   Sent:	Thursday, October 11, 2001 9:52 AM To:	Hayslett, Rod; McCarty, Danny Cc:	Waymire, Dave; Neubauer, Dave; Neville, Sue; Thomas, Steve Subject:	Redfield Deliverability Project  Rod,  We looking for your help on some ideas on how to implement a good long term project that has negative short term cash flow.  We have been working with Halliburton to identify deliverability improvements at Redfield through the use of  improved technology related to identifying poor performing wells and implementing down hole remediation.  This project has costs and revenues as shown below that are great from a long term standpoint.  Steve Thomas and Maurice Gilbert have done an excellent job of identifying the benefits to NNG and the upsides in revenue that are expected.  Dave Waymire has also been very helpful in analyzing alternative and economics and have shown that the project has a great return (in excess of 30%).  Our problem is that the cost for the workovers at Redfield are all O&M expenses and not capital and we have a negative IBIT for the first 2 - 3 years of the project.  We have proposed that Halliburton structure the expenses such that they come in over a 5 - 10 year period so we don't have this negative IBIT flow in the first years, however, Halliburton has not been interested and has proposed a 30% finance charge for this structure.  What would be the appetite for possibly pre-paying a majority of these costs in '01 to avoid the negative '02 and '03 earnings impact or is there an Enron company that would finance/extend the expense payments.  This is a great project that we should do, however, it is difficult given the negative earnings impacts in the first couple of years.  Got any ideas to handle this financial hurdle??????

Particularly the bank where the deceased had an account valued at 10 million United States dollars, they have issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the account confiscated within the next one month.   Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 3years now I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased so that the proceeds of this account valued at 10 million USD can be paid to you and then you and me can share the money 50% to me and 50% to you. I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim we may make like the Certificate of Deposit and Copy of Agreement issued to my client on the date of deposit, I also have a copy of the death Certificate of my client. All I require is your honest cooperation and maximum secrecy to enable us see this deal through.   I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Please get in touch with me through my email address above and repeated here  ( abrahamlegalfirm@rediffmail.com ) and send to me your personal telephone / fax numbers and email address to enable us discuss further about this transaction.

However, weak market fundamentals, including a sluggish economy and increased  US and Canadian supplies, will mitigate the usual winter price rise. CERA  expects an average Henry Hub price of $2.35 in November.  *  Although inventories are close to record levels, storage pressures are  increasingly unlikely to drive cash markets down significantly this year.   *  Gas demand will average 14 percent lower than a year earlier; residential  and commercial sectors show a decline with a return to normal weather, while a  weak economy offsets the return of ammonia and dual-fuel loads in the  industrial sector.  *  Regional storage inventories and weak regional demand should keep upward  pressure off of regional differentials.
