I have heavy issues with HOTMAIL since they reject ANY legitim messages as SPAM without any reason.  All of my 50 Servers are worldwide and in different subnets.  It is nearly impossible that all 50 Servers have spamed HOTMAIL, since my servers accept only authenticated SMTP from clients.  I am not registered on ANY blacklists (except  which is a crap service billing innocent ISP's and peoples instead of spamers) but can not send to my customers unsing HOTMAIL adresses.  since  exist, I am looking for the FRENCH legal address and I will su them since in Europe, E-Mail is falling under the ""Post- & Telecommunication Law"", which mean, rejecting legitim messages is like, the French Post is rejection any Letters coming from the USA.  And another problem is, that because of HOTMAIL I have already lost money...   And you know, ISP-Business is hard!  > Do away with Yahoo.

As I have written in a previosly message:  Since I can not reach my customers using  I reject all messages from them and leafe a message to let them know WHY.  And yes, this bounces are working fine and going correctly back to the sending  account...

To fully leverage this new class of multi-core hardware, software developers must change the way they create applications. By turning their focus to multi-threaded applications, developers will be able to take full advantage of multi-core devices and deliver software that meets the demands of the world. But this paradigm of multi-threaded software development adds a new wrinkle of complexity for those who care the utmost about software quality.    Click Here to View This Whitepaper               Improving .NET Application Performance and Reliability with Managed Database Data Connectivity                Many .NET applications fail to meet user requirements because they do not provide optimal access to underlying Oracle, Sybase, or DB2 databases. The root cause is often unmanaged ADO.NET data providers shipped by the database vendor or from Microsoft. In this paper, SQL Server MVP and SSWUG co-founder Stephen Wynkoop explores common misperceptions about data access technologies, describes the optimum architecture for ADO.NET data providers, and highlights key selection criteria for developers.

Cole's on Waugh To add to the next Newsletter:  Julie,  My partner and I have not been very visable at any of the local meetings,   however we ALWAYS anxiously await the next installment of the newsletter.  We  have been extremely busy making the house we bought  on Bomar liveable,  it  was barely that way when we bought it.  We wanted to add to your restaurant review.  Cole's on Waugh is a fairly decent restaurant with an OK menu.   The Garlic  soup was a definite hit,  and the atmosphere was great.  The wine list is  good and the prices were very reasonable. The entrees need a bit of work,  the beef was very ""Gamey"", the chicken  dishes were dry,  and the fried shrimp were a bit greasy.     All things aside we have eaten there three times,  and deem it worth while.   We have seen the menu and service improve with each visit.  Our hope is that  if enough people visit Cole's the menu will improve.  It is in a very  convenient location and the owners and staff are very friendly.

This is not so much ""clear"" as ""completely different"", but yes, that is the principle meaning of the word ""materials"" and the ony logical reason why the author would've used the term here.  A court is going to consider what the apparent intent was -- not try to stretch the meaning beyond the obvious.  > Would you expect an art *materials* catalogue to...  Hereafter, you are trying to stretch the meaning to something that it obviously wasn't intended to mean.  You can do that, because the license is POORLY WRITTEN. Which I have already said. Miraculously, you and I appear to AGREE on that point.  One consequence of this is that some lawyer might try to play the same games with the language that you are doing here.  I think the court would laugh in his face, but who knows?  > I'm trying to understand how it is possible to claim that compilers > don't fit the meaning of materials there  That would be by using the *normal*, *first* definition of ""materials"" and not some alternate meaning that has come about by association.  There is also the point that it wouldn't make any sense to require the meaning you are attempting to press: is there even a compiler which can be ""released in source format under conditions of this license""? If not, then it stands to reason that the author, knowing this, cannot have intended to limit compilation to such a hypothetical compiler. This is yet more evidence for an intent which agrees with the obvious interpretation of the language.  So, are you saying you honestly believe the author's intent was to block compilation of changes to his package altogether? If so, why distribute source at all? Furthermore, you believe that having this irrational intent, he then tried to hide it by using a word which *might* be interpreted to support his intent, but whose most obvious meaning contradicts it?  I find that a pretty implausible theory.  Your interpretation is distorts the license's original intent by using alternate meanings of words. As such it may even be semantically correct (that is, it may be within the set of possible semantic meanings of the utterance), but it is pragmatically incorrect (it is not the subset of that set that was meant by the author -- as we can tell from context). Intent is a matter of pragmatics[1] -- the study of situated utterances as evidence for meaning, not semantics[2] -- the study of isolated utterances for potential meaning.  You're pounding very hard on the semantics, trying to broaden the set of possible meanings, and you're not wrong about that as far as you go, but that's missing the point. The question was not ""what could this sentence possibly mean"", but ""what did this sentence mean when the author wrote it"" -- which is what actually matters legally.  The rest of the license, the fact of using the license, the fact of releasing software with source code and the consequences of licensing choices all provide situational information which supports the pragmatic interpretation of the sentence in question.  The fact that courts (or we) have to go beyond semantics to understand the license is a serious flaw of the license, which I've already pointed out, but as evidence of the author's actual intent, I think it is sufficient.

""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stret! ch! . Trent Dilfer , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point. Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 10/23/01 Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck fr! om! a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week. Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 10/23/01 The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams. Dedric Ward , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season. Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Neal/McKay Updated 10/23/01 Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week. Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week. Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Tori U! pd! ated 10/23/01 Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use him this week. Terrence Wilkins , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week. Terrell Davis , RB DEN - JWillie Updated 10/23/01 Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they will activate h! im! . He will work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Martin Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice until late in the week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota.  Duce Staley , RB PHI - Giggles Updated 10/23/01 Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on 11 carries l! at! e in the game. At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a solid replacement.  Joe Nedney , K TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week.  Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Kinney will be listed on the injury report because of a calf injury. However, he is expected to play in this week's game.  Kevin Dyson , WR TEN - Bass/Hull Updated 10/23/01 Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice. Eddie George , RB TEN - Tori Updated 10/23/01 George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in this week's game.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Martin Updated 10/23/01 McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game.  Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence.  Damon Jones , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery.  Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Martin Updated 10/23/01 Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's game remains uncertain. ""All I know is that, from week to week, they increase his exercises and change of direction,"" head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. ""It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week."" Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23.  Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to action next week.  Todd Heap , TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle.  Terry Allen , RB BAL - Tori Updated 10/23/01 Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at running back if Allen is inactive.  Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Tori Updated 10/23/01 Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. ""I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest area,"" Grbac said Monday. ""There could be something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see."" Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unable to play.  Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Neal/McKay Updated 10/23/01 Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orleans.  Trung Canidate , RB STL - Giggles Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. ""I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game,"" coach Mike Martz said. ""He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play."" Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week.  J.J. Stokes , WR SF - Matty Updated 10/23/01 Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close to being completely healthy. ""Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was a blessing for me because I was ab! le! to get treatment every day,"" Stokes told the Contra Costa Times . ""I practiced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close."" Stokes has been less than mediocre, however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to be more reliable.  Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - Russell Updated 10/23/01 Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants' starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed.  Ron Dixon , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day.  Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Matty Updated 10/23/01 According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans.

Based on that I can make these guesses:   X-Spam-Score seems to be score *10, and truncated instead of rounded.  This accounts for how -6.6 can become -65.. (-6.58 will round to -6.6,  but multiply and truncate and you get -65)  X-Spam-Bar probably generates a series of - or + signs for each full  point of score in that direction. (similar to SA's _STARS(*)_ tag, but  with negative scores represented). It's a wild guess, but seems reasonable."

He is expected to miss the game, however, so be sure to put him on reserve this week.  James Allen , RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01 With Anthony Thomas ailing, Allen will likely start Sunday's game against Minnesota. Considering the Vikings lack of a solid run defense, Allen would be a good Fantasy start in Week 11. !  Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - Martin Updated 11/23/01 According to publised reports, Thomas has been listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Minnesota. Thomas is nursing a hamstring injury, and will likely be replaced in the starting lineup by James Allen.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/23/01 Smith played Thursday but was ineffective. He gained only nine yards on nine carries. Smith remained on the sidelines for most of the second half.  Damon Jones , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01 The Jacksonville Jaguars placed Jones on the waivers-injured reserve list Thursday, effectively ending his five-year career with the team. He caught just eight passes this year before being sidelined with a shoulder injury.  James Stewart , RB DET - Hunter Updated 11/23/01 Stewart rushed for 102 yards on 14 carries Thursday, but left the game early with a stinger in his neck. He had missed the previous four games with a sprained right ankle, and is now listed as day to day.  Charlie Batch , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01 Batch was 8-of-19 for 118 yards with no touchdowns, an interception and a fumble before Mike McMahon, who played one series in the first half, replaced him midway through the fourth quarter. Batch said he couldn't plant and throw effectively because of a groin pull. His status for next week's game is uncertain.  Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01 Banks, who sustained a concussion in last week's game at Denver, returned to practice Thursday and remained on course to start Sunday's game at Philadelphia. He sat out Wednesday's practice as a precaution, but all his postgame tests were negative. Kent Graham, who relieved Banks in the 17-10 victory over the Broncos, will start if Banks has a setback.  Rod Smith , WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/23/01 Smith had seven catches for 81 yards Thursday despite playing on a sprained ankle. He also went over 1,000 yards for the fifth straight season. Smith might be the best receiver in football and is a must start every week.  Terrell Davis , RB DEN - JWillie Updated 11/23/01 Davis could be back next week at Miami. He has missed the last two games because of a torn meniscus. Olandis Gary , RB DEN - Frank Updated 11/23/01 Gary broke a bone in his left leg on the second drive of Thursday's game. He is likely out for the rest of the season. Mike Anderson will be the primary back, but Terrell Davis might be able to return next week.  Jeff Graham , WR SD - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Graham has been quiet recently, but may bust out of a mini-slump against the Cardinals. His yardage numbers should be respectable, and he may catch a TD pass. Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Giggles Updated 11/21/01 The loss of tight end Mark Bruener could have an adverse impact on Bettis' output over the final weeks of the season, but you still need to start him every week in your league. Bettis is likely to struggle against a decent Titans rush defense on Sunday, but he'll still give you serviceable stats and may even find the end zone. Curtis Conway , WR SD - Giggles Updated 11/21/01Expect a big game from Conway in Week 11. The Arizona pass defense has been very soft all year long. Kordell Stewart , QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 While the Steelers' passing game has improved in recent weeks, Stewart is still far too inconsistent to merit using on a weekly basis. He faces a weak Tennessee secondary on Sunday, which is a good matchup, but only use him if you're desperate for a starter in your league. Darrell Jackson , WR SEA - Hunter Updated 11/21/01 Jackson should play very well at Kansas City this week. Seattle will use their passing game early on to open up running lanes for Shaun Alexander, and Jackson will be a key receiver for Matt Hasselbeck. Tim Brown , WR OAK - Martin Updated 11/21/01 Raiders QB Rich Gannon should have plenty of time to locate Brown downfield in their game against the Giants on Sunday. Definitely get Brown into your active lineup this week. Charlie Garner , RB OAK - Russell Updated 11/21/01 Don't expect Garner to put up good stats against the Giants on Sunda! y.! Tyrone Wheatley has returned from an injury and New York is tough on the run. Only use Garner if you don't have another alternative on your roster. David Patten , WR NE - JWillie Updated 11/21/01 Patten and the Patriots go up against the Saints on Sunday. While he has been inconsistent all year long, this is a favorable matchup for the wideout. Patten could beat Fred Thomas downfield for a score, and you should consider using him as your No. 2 or 3 receiver. Troy Brown , WR NE - Bass/Hull Updated 11/21/01 Brown has been a very reliable receiver for his owners this season, and has only gotten better since Tom Brady has been throwing him the ball. Expect another solid week for Brown against a mediocre Saints secondary. Antowain Smith , RB NE - JWillie Updated 11/21/01 Smith has been a pleasant surprise for his Fantasy owners this season. He'll go up against a subpar Saints rush defense on Sunday, and we recommend you get him into your active lineup as a result. Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Matty Updated 11/21/01 Gadsden has been very inconsist! en! t this season, and we don't recommend you use him this week against the Bills. Let him prove himself before you consider putting him back into your active lineup the remainder of the season. James McKnight , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 There is a possibility McKnight could beat the Bills downfield for a few long passes on Sunday. However, he is only worth using in very deep leagues. Travis Minor , RB MIA - Giggles Updated 11/21/01 The Dolphins may use Minor a fair amount Sunday against Buffalo to keep the defense honest. He could be worth using in a deep league since the Bills have been weak against the run all season. Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - Russell Updated 11/21/01 Gonzalez will rack up good Fantasy stats Sunday against the Seahawks. While he has been somewhat of a disappointment, you need to keep him active every week. Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 11/21/01 Davis rushed for 84 yards against Denver last week, and was held out of the end zone once a! ga! in. He may struggle against Philadelphia in Week 11, but you may have no choice but to start him considering the lack of running back depth around the league.  Larry Parker , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Parker could get a touchdown pass Sunday against Seattle, as the Seahawks' secondary has regularly been burned by teams' second wideout options. He might make a good No. 3 receiver for this week. Tony Richardson , RB KC - Neal/McKay Updated 11/21/01 Richardson has fallen into a goal-line back role in recent games, and there's a chance he'll get a score against the Seahawks on Sunday. Kansas City should move the ball with relative ease, and if you are in a deep league or a touchdown-only league, he might be worth putting in your lineup. Priest Holmes , RB KC - Russell Updated 11/21/01 The Chiefs will use many plays to keep the Seahawks off balance on Sunday, which should help Holmes roll up some very good stats this week. We recommend you get him into your active lineup despite his struggles against the Jets in Week Nine. Trent Green , QB KC - Bass! /H! ull Updated 11/21/01 Green and the Chiefs slumped badly before their bye week, but should rebound Sunday against Seattle. Expect him to post decent stats against this questionable secondary, but don't rush to start him over a less mistake-prone quarterback.

Also, there is a vicious rumour going round that a year or so ago a rather large company in the UK lost a court case where an employee sent out some kind of libellous email or somesuch despite the company having implemented email disclaimers. pay no heed to this - its just a rumour (http://www.weblaw.co.uk/artemail.htm).Anyway, please: Email exel.com!!!> kevinNB: This email is copyright 2002 Paul Jakma.

This  decision was  based on the  automatic error monitoring policy  in effect for the  list, and has not  been reviewed or otherwise confirmed  by a human  being. If  you receive this  message, it means that  something is wrong: while  you are obviously able  to receive mail, your mail system has been regularly reporting that your account did not exist, or that you were otherwise permanently unable to receive mail. Here is some information which may assist  you or your local help desk in determining the cause of the problem:  - The failing address is ktwarwic@SPEEDY.UWATERLOO.CA.  - The first error was reported on 22 Jun 2007.  - Since then, a total of 3 delivery errors have been received.  - The last reported error was: Probe failed.  PLEASE DO NOT  IGNORE THIS MESSAGE. While you can  of course re-subscribe to the list, it is important for  you to report this problem to your mail administrator so that  it can be solved. This problem  is not specific to the HTMLQUICKNEWS  list, and also  affects your private mail.  This means that YOU HAVE  PROBABLY LOST SOME PRIVATE MAIL AS  WELL. Anyone trying to write to you  during the same time frame will  probably have received the same errors for the same reason. The HTMLQUICKNEWS list is but one of the many people who may have tried to write to you while your mail system was malfunctioning."

I don't think it is the same.  Part of OO functionality -- a MAJOR part, is that if the ""method"" is not defined local, they it checks the parent classes. 	The error message tells the user ""&localclass::method"" isn't found in ""$self->parentmethod;"".  The user will think ""I know that.  It is a parent method -- I wouldn't expect it to be in localclass.  Why doesn't it do the standard OO-lookup *before* returning ""undefined"".  If I DID NOT want an OO-call (that checks through parents), I could tell it to call the function as a local function.  Instead of      $self->method I'd use:      method($self).  But using the method-call syntax ""$self->method"", it should look through the parent classes for the method *before* throwing the undefined-error.   > d:\\>perl -e""my $x=\\&foo eval 'sub foo { warn qq(foo) }'; $x->()"" > foo at (eval 1) line 1. >  > d:\\>perl -e""my %f; my $r=\\$f{x}; $$r='testing'; print $f{x};"" > testing >  > The similarity in behavior is not unexpected, given that Perl's global > symbol tables are really just hashes in disguise. ---- 	BUT a hash table isn't something *DEFINED* to look in parent classes.  A method-call is.  They are not symmetric.   > The code you marked as #ln 22, and quoted above is the problem. > Essentially you are creating a function stub, which perl expects you > to fill in later, but you haven't filled it in. Since this produces > undesirable results you simply shouldn't do that.  ---- 	Well this is the solution others come up with -- but no one even knew ""why"" until I reported the bug.  It's confusing and not behaving as the OO-language lookup is supposed to.  > You should do something like >  >    my @dummy; push @dummy,(\\&boom) if defined *boom{CODE};     #ln 22 >  > which takes a reference to the sub only if it is actually defined. ---- 	That is yet ANOTHER great workaround.  That doesn't mean that a call, through a Blessed-ref shouldn't, *FIRST*, do the parental method lookup, before throwing the fatal error.  I would do the parental lookup just before throwing the ""Undefined"" error -- it doesn't have to be ""optimized"" -- just ""work"".  	This is another part that is ""really wrong"".  The user cannot rely on the built-in ""can()"" function to determine if the method is safe to call.  I tried to ""protect"" the calls -- but 'can' returns true if there has been a reference to the same-name, but undefined local function.  You can't use ""defined($self->method)"" as a replacement for $self->can('method');  	I acknowledge that this is not as str8tforward a fix as one might like, but I believe this area is hit more often than the bug report numbers represent.  Too many perl-experts knew the workaround, but couldn't say WHY what I was doing failed.  Narrowing down to the point where I could get others to understand the bug and to where felt I had a handle on it well enough to *report the bug*, took a bit of persistence.  I'd guess most people wouldn't bother to find the ""root cause"" let along get it to the point of filing it in a bug."

""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stret! ch! . Trent Dilfer , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point. Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 10/23/01 Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck fr! om! a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week. Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 10/23/01 The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams. Dedric Ward , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season. Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Neal/McKay Updated 10/23/01 Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week. Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week. Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Tori U! pd! ated 10/23/01 Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use him this week. Terrence Wilkins , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week. Terrell Davis , RB DEN - JWillie Updated 10/23/01 Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they will activate h! im! . He will work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Martin Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice until late in the week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota.  Duce Staley , RB PHI - Giggles Updated 10/23/01 Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on 11 carries l! at! e in the game. At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a solid replacement.  Joe Nedney , K TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week.  Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Kinney will be listed on the injury report because of a calf injury. However, he is expected to play in this week's game.  Kevin Dyson , WR TEN - Bass/Hull Updated 10/23/01 Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice. Eddie George , RB TEN - Tori Updated 10/23/01 George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in this week's game.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Martin Updated 10/23/01 McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game.  Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence.  Damon Jones , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery.  Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Martin Updated 10/23/01 Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's game remains uncertain. ""All I know is that, from week to week, they increase his exercises and change of direction,"" head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. ""It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week."" Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23.  Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to action next week.  Todd Heap , TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle.  Terry Allen , RB BAL - Tori Updated 10/23/01 Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at running back if Allen is inactive.  Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Tori Updated 10/23/01 Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. ""I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest area,"" Grbac said Monday. ""There could be something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see."" Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unable to play.  Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Neal/McKay Updated 10/23/01 Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orleans.  Trung Canidate , RB STL - Giggles Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. ""I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game,"" coach Mike Martz said. ""He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play."" Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week.  J.J. Stokes , WR SF - Matty Updated 10/23/01 Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close to being completely healthy. ""Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was a blessing for me because I was ab! le! to get treatment every day,"" Stokes told the Contra Costa Times . ""I practiced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close."" Stokes has been less than mediocre, however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to be more reliable.  Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - Russell Updated 10/23/01 Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants' starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed.  Ron Dixon , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day.  Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Matty Updated 10/23/01 According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. ""I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago,"" Martz said. ""I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play."" Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to go.

phishing,legitimate,True,legitimate,"No Confidence in Congress Lou Dobbs Tonight Thursday, June 21, 2007  Tonight, a new Gallup poll reveals only 14 percent of Americans have confidence in the United States Congress. This poll comes on the heels of several others showing Congressional and Presidential approval ratings at the lowest level in years. What in the world is going on in Washington, and what can we do about it? We'll ask and asnwer those questions tonight.  More than 15 million children are at risk of dropping out of our nations schools, according to the Office of Juvenile Justice Department. With already more than a million students not lining up to graduate this year, there is a new outcry for parental involvement in childrens lives. Studies list parental involvement as key when it comes to combating dropout rates. Well have a full report tonight.  Illegal aliens are now taking extreme measures to cross our southern border, including starting fires near observation towers. The Border Patrol says apprehensions are down, but are these new diversion tactics to blame? We'll have a special report.  Senators Ted Kennedy and Dianne Feinstein held a press conference today touting the importance of a provision for illegal alien agricultural workers in the Senates immigration reform bill.  Meanwhile Senators Jim DeMint, Chuck Grassley and David Vitter are held a press conference discussing why the Senates so-called grand compromise will only repeat the failures of the past. Well report on the battle to get the bill back out on the floor.  And well take a look at the latest developments towards the creation of a North American Union between the United States, Mexico and Canada.  We'll also discuss the Senate's grand compromise on immigration with Senator Claire McCaskill. The Senator says we will never get a handle on illegal immigration until we hold employers accountable.  Visit http://cnn.com/loudobbstonight to read Lous latest commentary on a legacy in search of a president: More than 1.2 million students will not graduate public high school this year. Somebody needs to fix our broken education system in this country. Will the president assert real leadership on this issue?  Lou Dobbs lays out his manifesto to save the middle class in his new book, War on the Middle Class: How the Government, Big Business, and Special Interest Groups Are Waging War on the American Dream and How to Fight Back.

I want the land to be forever fertile in America."" With a blink of the genie's eye, 'FOOM'  -  the land in America was forever made fertile for farming.  The Frenchman was amazed, so he said, ""I want a wall around France, so that no one can come into our precious country.""  Again, with a blink of the Genie's eye, 'POOF'  -  there was a huge wall around France.  The Englishman asks, ""I'm very curious. Please tell me more about this wall.  The Genie explains, ""Well, it's about 150 feet high, 50 feet thick and nothing can get in or out.""  The Englishman says, ""Fill it up with water.""

The professor tries Scotland next ""Hoots an' toots man, I put her back legs down my nice green wellies, grab her with me velcro gloves, and we're  well away. Och aye tha noo!""  The professor moves on to Germany: ""Well, I find the most efficient way is to grab her with my velcro gloves, and we're well away. The professor is noticing a pattern developing, so he decides to try France, and then end his investigation.  He stops a bloke by the Eiffel tower named Pierre, and asks him to explain the French method: ""Well monsieur, I put her back legs down my nice green wellies, sling her front legs over me shoulders, and that's all there is to it!"" The professor is excited to have found some national variation and tells Pierre that this is different to the methods of the Scots, Welsh and Germans.

Go crazy and try a new iced coffee flavor or wear a funky color underwear, even if it's doubtful that anyone will ever see them. Gemini:Your flair for remembering weird facts will come in handy today. You'll bring up something totally random to divert attention away from yet another sticky situation that you've gotten yourself into. Cancer:You'll butt heads with someone today due to 'creative differences.' The difference is that one of you isn't creative, and that's you. Let someone else come up with the unique ideas since all of yours are lame. Leo:Technology is not your friend when it comes to communicating today. In fact, messages probably spread faster in the Stone Age than via your computer. Use your land line if you want to touch base with someone or choose to remain incommunicado. Virgo:You're at it again. Buying things on a whim just to make yourself feel less empty inside. Sorry babe, but even truckloads of material possessions are going to bring you out of the dumps. Libra:Just because you're in the mood to socialize doesn't mean that others will be receptive to your conversational advances. You've been blowing off people left and right. Why the heck should they bother with you? Scorpio:Keep your fingers crossed that someone comes to your defense today. If you don't, then you're going to have a lot of explaining to do, and for once you didn't even do anything wrong!  Sagittarius:Say a goal aloud today. If you put it out there, then you might have a slight chance of it coming to fruition. It won't magically happen, though. You have to put some work into it, ya lazy bum. Capricorn:Today isn't the day to ask for a raise, or for any money for that matter. Your boss doesn't think you deserve it and your friends are a bunch of moochers. Aquarius:Whether you realize it or not, it'll be obvious to everyone that you're dealing with some issues. Drop the act and let people know what's going on. They like you better when you're not a total fake. Pisces:It's time to get off the roller coaster and find a kiddie ride that you can handle.

phishing,legitimate,True,legitimate,"Blown away To view this email as a web page, go to the link below, or copy and paste it into your browser's address window. http://click.email.johnkerry.com/?ju=fe6316757361027d7510&ls=fdf715747c670c7977157370&m=fefd1273716607&l=fecd177070660c7d&s=fe2f167176660674721171&jb=ffcf14&t=     Dear Ted,  With eight consecutive victories, and a momentum for change that is rolling  across the nation -- in caucuses and primaries, East Coast and West Coast, the  South and the Midwest, Barack Obama is on the move, smashing the old  stereotypes into a million different pieces.  This blew me away: in Barack's victory in Virginia last night, he won 142,000  more votes than all of the Republicans combined, and his victory margin over  Senator Clinton was larger than John McCain's entire vote total. All of this,  in what the Old Guard liked to pretend was ""red state"" Virginia.  When Barack and I rode together in the motorcade in Charleston, South Carolina  on the day I gave him my endorsement, we talked about the three-million-member- strong johnkerry.com community. We both agreed that this email list was a  community of supporters, not an ATM machine.  And so these last weeks, as I've talked with you, as Barack introduced himself  to you, as Ted Kennedy talked about Barack's commitment to health care for all,  and Gov. Tim Kaine talked about Barack's ability to unite our country -- we  haven't asked you to dig into your pockets.  We've asked you to get to know  Barack, to study his positions, to make phone calls to your neighbors, to go  door to door -- to get involved.  But today, I ask you to consider making a contribution as the campaign enters a  new phase. Wisconsin, Texas, Ohio, Pennsylvania -- the next big contests in  this campaign are big media market states, huge states that are expensive to  build statewide field organizations in, and Barack has a lot of ground to make  up. To win, Barack can use all of our help.  Click here to donate what you can: http://click.email.johnkerry.com/?ju=fe6216757361027d7511&ls=fdf715747c670c7977157370&m=fefd1273716607&l=fecd177070660c7d&s=fe2f167176660674721171&jb=ffcf14&t=    So there it is. I know not everyone here is an Obama supporter, and diversity  of opinion is a strength, not a weakness of our community -- but you've ""had my  back"" in so many fights these last years, I knew I could ask you to consider  signing up for another mission.  I have to tell you, this campaign has me excited. Excited, because I have seen  so much hope out there as I've traveled the country for Barack. Excited,  because as frustrated as I've been that the three words ""George W. Bush""  silenced any conversation at dinner tables around the country the last  eight years, I think we've found three words that will open a conversation  across the old divides, regardless of race, religion, gender, or income level -- and those three words are ""President Barack Obama"".  So please, click here to contribute what you can for Barack's campaign: http://click.email.johnkerry.com/?ju=fe6216757361027d7511&ls=fdf715747c670c7977157370&m=fefd1273716607&l=fecd177070660c7d&s=fe2f167176660674721171&jb=ffcf14&t=   I care about making this happen. I care about seeing Barack Obama win against  John McCain in a way that will break the Republican Roadblock in the Senate and  grow our progressive majority in the Congress.  Please dig deep -- I know we can do this.   This feels like the moment that got me and my generation to care about  politics -- and I want it to be the moment that millions more start to care for  the first time, or to care again, the way that you and I do now.   Thank you, John Kerry     http://click.email.johnkerry.com/?ju=fe4d1675736101747c1d&ls=fdf715747c670c7977157370&m=fefd1273716607&l=fecd177070660c7d&s=fe2f167176660674721171&jb=ffcf14&t=      Paid for by John Kerry For U.S. Senate ---------------------------------------- 	 	This email was sent by: 	John Kerry for Senate 	129 Portland St., Ste. 500 	Boston, MA, 02114, USA 	 	We respect your right to privacy - visit the following URL to view our policy.

Conflicts about moral claims are part of what it means to be  human, and a political ideal stripped of sentimentality and the  utopian temptation is one committed to the notion that political  life is a permanent agon between clashing, even incompatible  goods.   -- Jean Bethke Elshtain, Real Politics     It is the irresolvable love-hate agon between men and women that  drives all cultures.   -- Lawrence Osborne, ""False goddess"", Salon, June 28, 2000     Almost every poem Auden wrote in the weeks before and after his  arrival in New York portrayed the agon of an artist in combat  with his gift.   -- Edward Mendelson, Later Auden    -------------------------------------------------------------------  Agon comes from Greek agon, ""a struggle or contest."" It is related to agony.  Dictionary.com Entry and Pronunciation for agon   Note: Audio pronunciation available only to Premium members.

I have you down for $61 plus shipping, not $1,600.  I show that you bid at $6.99 and at $61.  There was no bid for $19.99 listed at all.  I am sorry if you did not mean to bid $61, but it is hardly out of the range - these balls were selling this weekend for $80-90.  If your winning bid was $200 or higher I could understand your complaint and we could make an adjustment, but $61 is not an unreasonable amount.  Please let me know if you are planning on paying the $61(I will pay shipping if you use PayPal).  If not, I need to contact EBay for resolution.  I need a response as soon as possible.  Thanks.

It's certainly possible to have getpass() read from stdin automatically, but it's traditionally understood that having it read from a tty is much, much better.  Suppose your program were meant to use getpass, and then read a file from stdin.  Now, all of a sudden, you miss the first line of the file, and it becomes your password, for no particular reason.  getpass() works the way it does because it's been working that way in C for decades.  If you really want to maintain a 'configuration file' for your password, or have it available on command line, try adding an option like -p  or -p  to whatever program you're writing.  --  Cheers, Leif _______________________________________________ Python-Dev mailing list zvllln-eum@python.org http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-dev Unsubscribe: http://mail.python.org/mailman/options/python-dev/python-dev%40tangomu.com"
phishing,legitimate,True,legitimate,"*EMCA* An additional Restaurant Review..... Cole's on Waugh To add to the next Newsletter:  Julie,  My partner and I have not been very visable at any of the local meetings,   however we ALWAYS anxiously await the next installment of the newsletter.  We  have been extremely busy making the house we bought  on Bomar liveable,  it  was barely that way when we bought it.  We wanted to add to your restaurant review.  Cole's on Waugh is a fairly decent restaurant with an OK menu.   The Garlic  soup was a definite hit,  and the atmosphere was great.  The wine list is  good and the prices were very reasonable. The entrees need a bit of work,  the beef was very ""Gamey"", the chicken  dishes were dry,  and the fried shrimp were a bit greasy.     All things aside we have eaten there three times,  and deem it worth while.   We have seen the menu and service improve with each visit.  Our hope is that  if enough people visit Cole's the menu will improve.  It is in a very  convenient location and the owners and staff are very friendly.
