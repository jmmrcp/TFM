legitimate,phishing,True,"Bike Diary #6 Day 13 Date: Thursday July 5, 2001 Distance: 85 miles Moving average speed: 13.1 mph Left at: 8:00 AM Arrived at: 4:00 PM Overnight in: cyclist shelter in Monroeville, IN Latitude 40 d 58 m 7 s N Longitude 84 d 51 m 55 s W Cumulative distance: 1058 miles  Today I passed two major milestones: I crossed another state border (Ohio to Indiana, and yes, I took that picture of the sign), and I logged my 1000th mile.  Now it's easy to extrapolate forward: if I covered 1000 miles in 13 days then I should cover 4000 miles in 52 days, which is 7 weeks and 3 days, within the range of my 6-to-8 week predeparture prediction.  52 days from my starting date (June 23) is August 13.  I would estimate the error on that prediction to be +/- 4 days, on the grounds that I added 1 day of riding to the first 1000 miles to nurse an injured knee, which extrapolates to 4 days over 4000 miles.  The weather today was fine, sunny with a high in the 70s, and the riding conditions would have been perfect were it not for the damn headwind.  It was from the northwest this time, so I could get a  little component of it behind me every time my route turned a little bit south.  But along the stretches of roads aligned due west it was a real grind.  I should digress on the subject of that headwind.  If I could have a nickel for every time somebody has told me that I am riding the ""wrong way"" across the country because the prevailing winds blow from west to east, then I would start getting invited to Bill Gates' parties.  Generally speaking, my interlocutors do not even appreciate the full difficulty of riding from east to west, because not only are the prevailing winds against you, but so are the prevailing hills.  You may recall from a previous Bike Diary entry my discussion of why it is that one should always prefer to go gradually down hill as opposed to an exhilerating rapid descent that squanders all the energy gained from climbing into wind resistance (this is not my opinion, it is a fact of physics).  Well, if you think about it, Denver is a mile high (5000 feet above sea level), but still east of the Front Range of the Rockies.  The Mississippi River, on the other hand, is only a few hundred feet above sea level.  This is true everywhere as you approach the Rockies from the east (for example, Cut Bank, MT on my route is just short of 4000 feet elevation).  Therefore, going west across the great plains you are gradually climbing, only to rapidly descend again when you get across the continental divide. The eastbounders, on the other hand, get the benefit of playing out their altitude gain gradually over a long distance as they descend across the great plains.  So, why go west?  Personally, I feel that flying to the west coast and bicycling back is the moral equivalent of getting air lifted to the top of Everest, skiing down to the base camp and then claiming to have climbed the mountain.  It is as if you wanted the bragging rights to say you rode your bicycle across the country, but you wanted to obtain them with the least amount of exertion necessary.  If you live on the east coast, and you want to ride across the continent, it seems perfectly obvious to me that what you need to do is ride west.  One should not undertake such a project as this if you want to do something easy.  OK, end of tirade.  Just remember this the next time you meet someone who claims to have bicycled across the country: the westbounders are the real cyclists.  Speaking of westbounders, I may be closing in on some ahead of me. I stopped in at the bicycle store in Defiance, OH to see if they had any news of westbounders.  Apparently a couple, short in stature, had passed through four days ago.  I wonder if this is the same couple making a perimeter tour that I heard about from the scruffy eastbounder on route 20 in upstate NY (see Day 4, Bike Diary #2).  If so, they were 8-9 days ahead of me then and are only 4 days ahead of me now, so I may be closing the gap.  In 10 days I've gained 4 on them, with 4 more to go, so I would guess that I will probably catch up to them in another 10 days, around July 15.  Stay tuned.  I'm spending tonight in Monroeville, IN.  Monroeville is like the set of a Frank Capra movie: you have your supper in the Village Cafe (two fried pork chops with mashed potatoes and gravy and a side salad for six bucks) and a chocolate malted from the Whippy Dip for dessert. The clientele of the Whippy Dip is a small crowd of flirting teenagers, there's a little league baseball game going on the playing field in the city park, and after dark the fireflies come out in swarms. You may have thought that places like this didn't exist any more, but here in middle America civil small town life is alive and well. You don't lock up your bike and you don't worry about it, either.  My accomodation here in Monroeville is a pavillion in the city park that has been set up as a shelter specifically for long distance touring cyclists.  There's a small bathroom with every imaginable amenity from warm shower to washer/dryer for your laundry.  The hospitable residents of Monroeville expect nothing in return: you can leave a donation but there's no obligation.  There's a guest book where you can leave your name, starting point and destination, and from the list of names it appears that Monroeville is a popular destination for touring cyclists: there's a few coming through every couple of days. I scanned the list for evidence of westbounders ahead of me to no avail.  Day 14 Date: Friday July 6, 2001 Distance: 83 miles Moving average speed: 14.1 mph Left at 7:30 AM Arrived at 2:30 PM Overnight in Salamonie River State Forest near Wabash, IN Latitude 40 d 48 m 42 s N Longitude 85 d 41 m 53 s W Cumulative distance: 1141  Although I rode 83 miles today, I only advanced 56 along the route to Seattle.  There were two reasons for the extra 27 miles today, the first was an inadvertent detour first thing in the morning when I left Monroeville headed in the wrong direction.  Here's and important fact for you future trans-America cyclists to remember: the sun rises in the east and sets in the west.  Therefore, if you are navigating the midwestern grid on a sunny morning thinking that you are going west but you do not see your shadow in front of you, then something is terribly wrong. It took me about three or four miles to notice this discrepancy, miles which I had to double back, of course.  The second detour was up to Fort Wayne to pick up some mail that my friends Maria and Kate sent me (thanks Kate! thanks Maria!).  I love mail.  The rest of the day was full of county roads and cornfields in Indiana. The wind more or less behaved itself today, starting the morning from the southeast before settling back into its usual pattern of coming from the southwest.  It wasn't much of a wind in either direction, maybe 5-10 mph.  I could easily have made it a longer day, but there is a real scarcity of services along this particular stretch of the route.  The next campground is 38 miles farther on, and there isn't a motel in the next 87 miles.  I probably could have managed the 38 miles to the next campground, but in deference to my still aching knees I quit much earlier in the afternoon than I would normally.  It looks like I made an impressively early start today, but that turns out to be a bit of a trick.  Although most of Indiana is in the eastern time zone, the state does not observe daylight savings time (except for the part in the cental time zone, just for maximum confusion) so at this time of year I crossed into the central time zone for all practical purposes when I crossed the Indiana border.  My campground tonight is a ""primitive facility"" which translates to no shower and pit toilets.  Generally speaking, I don't much mind primitive campgrounds as they are generally alot emptier than the ones that cater to the RV crowd and provide full hookups (water and electrical).  This one is an exception to that rule: there's hardly a vacant site.  I suppose it must be because of the holiday weekend since there isn't anything terribly exciting to do in the neighborhood. Most of the other campers are sitting in their sites experimenting  with all the noise-making gear they have brought along (firecrackers, car stereos, bongo drums, you name it).  Oh well, after all these days on the road I think I could sleep through anything.  Day 15 Date: Saturday July 7, 2001 Distance: 86 miles Moving average speed: 12.1 mph Left at 9:30 AM Arrived at 6:15 PM Overnight in White House B&B in Rensselaer, IN Latitude 40 d 55 m 52 s N Longitude 87 d 9 m 6 s W Cumulative distance: 1227 miles  I awoke this morning at 5 AM (EST) to the sound of distant thunder.  At first, I didn't realize that it was thunder I was hearing.  I'm accustomed to thunder as an intermitent booming; the sound I hear this morning was a continuous background.  After I had ruled out military aircraft on manueovers as a possible source for the sound I heard, I realized that I was in big trouble.  My immediate thought was ""strike the tent and seek shelter"".  That probably seems strange to alot of people who figure that the tent IS shelter, but you may recall from my first night's experience that if the tent is pitched on a slope, then it provides precious little shelter from runoff soaking through the floor of the tent.  I had once again pitched the tent on a slope, not expecting rain.  In fact, it seemed that most of the folks in the campground were not expecting (or at least prepared for) the rain that came.  By 6 AM I had my gear stowed my gear and loaded on the bicycle, and I moved myself and the bicycle to the only shelter on the campground: a pavillion that protected, ironically enough, the campground's water supply. The water supply itself was nothing but a spigot, but it spilled into a catch basin that looked like it came out of a coroner's office: it was a shallow sink no wider than usual but long enough to lay down in.  The pavillion overhangs this sink by three or four feet on any side, therefore the entire sheltered area was no bigger than about eight by ten feet.  At 6:10 AM the rains came with a vengance.  I cannot remember the last time I saw such torrential rain and so much lightning.  I believe that more than four inches of rain fell during the next three and a half hours, with lightning hitting very close to where I was standing.  I now could under- stand why the distant thunder had been continuous, because I was now standing in the middle of it.  And there I stood, for about three and a half hours, making light conversation with some of the other campers who dared step out in the storm and waiting for it to end.  One guy seemed to have an unnaturally detailed knowledge of the roads and motels of Indiana; when I asked him what line of work he was in he said he was following power lines.  Apparently utilities hire these guys to go around the state following the power lines to make sure there are no trees nearby that threaten to fall on them.  At 9:30 AM it was clear that the worst of the storm had passed and I decided to head out and make the most of what was left of the day. I'm pretty much ready to get out of Indiana, having already spent more time crossing Ohio than I had hoped.  The day started out as a more or less routine one of grinding out miles across cornfields.  The wind was quite strong in the aftermath of the storm, but it had returned to its normal direction (southwest), so I concluded that the rain was probably over for the day.  The weather was hot and humid, and the pace pretty slow.  I ran into some eastbounders in Denver, IN.  I wouldn't have recognized them as tourists because they were travelling on unloaded bikes, but one of them stopped to talk to me.  They are a group of three men in their late 50s/early 60s doing the Northern Tier in sections while somebody's wife drives the camper/sag-wagon behind.  Boy, these guys have it easy: not only are they eastbound but supported as well!  And he had the nerve to complain to me about headwinds!  ""Take a look at that flag"" I said.  My goal for today after I realized that it would be abbreviated by rain was to make it to Rensselaer, IN.  I'm passing through a part of Indiana where the campgrounds are scarce (and so is the population), so I had to shoot for a town with a motel.  Upon, arriving in Rensselaer, I was greeted by a parade of hot-rods (in fact, some locals had stopped me about two miles from town to warn me that it was happening today). I would estimate that there was well over one hundred cars in the parade, and after it was over they proceeded to cruise the town revving engines and peeping tires much to the delight of the townsfolk, who had turned out to the last man to observe the spectacle.  I suppose this is some sort of July Forth weekend event that happens every year.  I ended up picking the B&B for the night since the only other option was a motel on the interstate.  It might have been cheaper, but I would really hate staying on an interstate strip four miles outside of town.  At least this way I could walk around town and watch the cars go by.  I think I was making slightly better time on foot than the cruisers were, but maybe that's their point.",0

It's certainly possible to have getpass() read from stdin automatically, but it's traditionally understood that having it read from a tty is much, much better.  Suppose your program were meant to use getpass, and then read a file from stdin.  Now, all of a sudden, you miss the first line of the file, and it becomes your password, for no particular reason.  getpass() works the way it does because it's been working that way in C for decades.  If you really want to maintain a 'configuration file' for your password, or have it available on command line, try adding an option like -p  or -p  to whatever program you're writing.  --  Cheers, Leif _______________________________________________ Python-Dev mailing list zvllln-eum@python.org http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-dev Unsubscribe: http://mail.python.org/mailman/options/python-dev/python-dev%40tangomu.com",0

It has become a living hell for citizens of Baghdad just trying to get through an average day, as correspondent Lara Logan reports in our second story. How does one live in such a place? Very carefully, reports Logan, and often with the protection of a weapon, or in the case of Dr. Quoresh al-Kasir, the U.S. military. Nearly 200 doctors have been murdered in Iraq by insurgents intent on destroying Iraqi society. Soon after bullets began to crash through his windows, Dr. Quoresh heard a hopeful sound. ""We heard the helicopters starting to come to the area. My sons and daughter said, 'Oh, Baba, the Americans started to reach the area.'""     Watch  Logan's Reporter's Notebook.        The firing of Don Imus for uttering racially charged and misogynistic words black rap stars routinely use in their lyrics has shifted the spotlight to hip-hop culture and its dark messages.  As you'll see in our third piece, CNN's Anderson Cooper discovers that one of the rappers' popular messages, ""stop snitchin',"" does not help the police, but has actually confounded investigators' efforts to solve crimes, especially murder, and has now created some lawless neighborhoods.  Says Geoffrey Canada, educator and anti-violence advocate from New York City's Harlem neighborhood, ""It's like we're saying to the criminals, 'You can have our community....Do anything you want and we will either deal with it ourselves or we'll simply ignore it.'""     Watch  Cooper's Reporter's Notebook.        These stories, and Andy Rooney's love affair with books, this Sunday, April 22, on 60 Minutes at 7 p.m. ET/PT.

legitimate,phishing,True,"RE: Redfield Deliverability Project I would appear to me that there may be some misconceptions here.     Why do we assume that by entering into a financing deal we will be any better off?  I would tell you that to the extent there was any risk in the deal, that we should probably charge someone else about 25-30% as well.     Think about it, 25% is only 15% after tax.   Has some one enumerated the risks and valued them on this deal?   I haven't seen any of that work, if it has been done.           I think I understand the concept proposed and I understand the proposed goal line, return with little or no expense up front.     I would assume that we would be willing to enter into a fixed price service agreement for a number of years?     Is Halliburton willing to take any risks whatsoever?  Alternatively, why don't we go through GSS (Global Strategic Sourcing) to look for a better deal?	  Jim:   Have you looked at this for ideas on the accounting side?    Why can't I do a prepayment of a service contract fee and recognize the expense over the life of the deal?   -----Original Message----- From: 	Waymire, Dave   Sent:	Wednesday, October 17, 2001 9:17 AM To:	Hayslett, Rod; Gilbert, Steve Cc:	Centilli, James Subject:	RE: Redfield Deliverability Project  Rod,  Below is some background on the Redfield Deliverability Project.  Halliburton initiated the contact with NNG to provide work over on selected wells based on software modeling in order to return deliverability to their original levels.  The work overs are planned over a 2-3 year period and are expected to have a lasting effect of at least 10 years.  The cost to model and rework these wells is estimated to be $5.73MM.  A test program would be conducted in the first year to determine the feasibility of continuing the program at a cost of $768,000.  If the test program did not prove out the project would be terminated at this point.  The original proposal was to treat the costs of the program as expense as the costs were incurred. Bob Chandler confirmed this accounting treatment.  This would result as Kent has indicated negative EBIT for the first 2-3 years.   As an alternative it was proposed to Halliburton that NNG would enter into a 10 year service agreement with Halliburton to model and rework the wells and provide guidance on proposed well work overs for the Redfield storage field.  Halliburton would agree to perform the test program and if test results indicate that further work overs would be economically feasible would spend an additional $4.96MM on a total of 60 well workovers in the first 3 years of the contract.  NNG currently budgets $300,000 per year for Redfield well maintenance with minimal increase in deliverability. Operations has committed $300,000 per year in well maintenance over the next 5 years to this project for a total of $1.5MM.  Halliburton has not formalized their counter offer, but has indicated that they would require a 25% to 30% return for assuming the financing.  Halliburton indicated that this is a non-standard deal for them and that is the reason for high return requirement.    The objective is to structure the deal as a service agreement either with an Enron Entity who would then contract with Halliburton or some other third party at a more reasonable rate.  Even at an estimated 30% return, preliminary incremental EBIT estimates for the Halliburton service agreement are between $400,000 to $500,000 the first 5 years and  $250,00 to $275,000 for the out years.       -----Original Message----- From: 	Hayslett, Rod   Sent:	Friday, October 12, 2001 7:05 AM To:	Gilbert, Steve Cc:	Waymire, Dave Subject:	RE: Redfield Deliverability Project  Couple of quick comments.

We have been working with Halliburton to identify deliverability improvements at Redfield through the use of  improved technology related to identifying poor performing wells and implementing down hole remediation.  This project has costs and revenues as shown below that are great from a long term standpoint.  Steve Thomas and Maurice Gilbert have done an excellent job of identifying the benefits to NNG and the upsides in revenue that are expected.  Dave Waymire has also been very helpful in analyzing alternative and economics and have shown that the project has a great return (in excess of 30%).  Our problem is that the cost for the workovers at Redfield are all O&M expenses and not capital and we have a negative IBIT for the first 2 - 3 years of the project.  We have proposed that Halliburton structure the expenses such that they come in over a 5 - 10 year period so we don't have this negative IBIT flow in the first years, however, Halliburton has not been interested and has proposed a 30% finance charge for this structure.  What would be the appetite for possibly pre-paying a majority of these costs in '01 to avoid the negative '02 and '03 earnings impact or is there an Enron company that would finance/extend the expense payments.  This is a great project that we should do, however, it is difficult given the negative earnings impacts in the first couple of years.  Got any ideas to handle this financial hurdle??????

I think that I would be happy to begin to try and get the CPUC to modify their Order right now, but my real concern (maybe unfounded) is that we don't want the CPUC to go all the way back to Jan 4 and refund the 1c/kwh to Direct Access customers.  I thought this would harm EES given our de-dasr activities?  This is what I mean by ""finessing"" the issue too much.  The only legitimate positions are no application back to Jan 4 or to fight for a clean-up after the retail rate freeze ends. I make this based on the following.  First, it is hard for EES to push much at the CPUC.  Second, after the CPUC takes what will be a potentially direct access killing action on Aug 23, I don't think they are going to be interested in dealing with a ""detail"" that matters for only for direct access customers.  Finally, I need to understand the value of this effort in line with the other key value drivers - and also, are you completely sure that there isn't a change (however unforseen) that could hurt another of our positions.

I would appreciate comments from anyone, pro or > con, with knowledge and experience of these things, however, as I'm rather > limited on both.  I agree - it's never a good idea to use the same data for creating your classifier and determining it's effectiveness (I meant to say ""pick the one with the lowest error rate on your TEST data"").  The reason to choose from many random starts is that fitting a given neural network _model_ (ie. input x, n nodes, ...) is very hard due to the large overparameterisation of the problem space.  For example, the parameters for one node in a given layer can be exchanged with the parameters of another node (as well as the parameters that use those nodes in next layer), without changing the overall model.  This makes it very hard to optimise, and nnet in R often gets stuck in local minima. Looking at what individual nodes are doing, you often see examples where some nodes contribute nothing to the overall classification. The random starts aren't to find different models but to find the parameters for the given model that fits best.  And following this line of argument, you would probably want to use the internal criterion value, rather than some external measure of accuracy.  > The simple answer to the question of obtaining the error rate using > validation data is: Do whatever you like to choose/fit a classifier on the > training set. **Once you are done,** the estimate of your error rate is the > error rate you get on applying that classifier to the validation set.

You need yet new validation data for that.  Understanding that that estimate is biased is important, but in practice, do people really care that much?  If you have looked at a single plot of your data and used that to inform your choice of the classifier your estimates will already be biased (but if you have used other knowledge of the data or subject area, you might expect them to be biased in a positive direction). Are the estimates of model really the most important thing?  Surely an understanding of the problem/data is what you are really trying to gain.

phishing,legitimate,True,"CAN I TRUST YOU ON THIS   Dear Sir/Madam Compliment of the day to you . I got your contact through business search from the internet. I am Mr.Mustapha Momodu, Account Manager of Standard Chartered Bank Kanashie Branch . I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On December 29th 2002, an American contractor with the Government of Ghana, Mr. Michael Creek made a numbered time (Fixed) deposited for twelve calendar months, valued at TWENTY TWO Million,Four hundred thousand dollars ($22.4million) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, that Mr. Michael Creek died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he did not leave a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Michael Creek did not declare any next of kin in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork. This sum of $22.4million is still sitting in Standard Chartered Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.  No one will come forward to claim it. According to the laws of the country, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to assist me fully as foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Michael creek,  so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide me immediately with your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavites, which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of two attorneys for drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 30% for you while 10% will be set aside for miscellaneous expenses. There is no risk involved in this transaction, as every necessary paperwork for this fund, will be done and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. Hope this mail will meet your perfect understanding. Best Regards. Mr.Mustapha Momodu  P/S:You can contact me also via my private email at mr_mustapha_stb@yahoo.com",1

phishing,legitimate,True,"URGENT REPLY PLEASE. Dear Friend,  Attention Please.   Sorry to disturb you. I am Dr Idris Ali, the Director in charge of Auditing  and Accounting section of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B) Ouagadougou  Burkina-faso West Africa. With due respect and regard. I have decided to  contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both  of us at the end of the transaction .   During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came  across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a  plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank  without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or  relation before our discovery to this development.   The said amount was U.S 7.5M (Seven Million,Five Hundred Thousand United  States Dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive  information through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole arrangement  to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get  the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been  put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as  soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist, and also  benefit your self to this great business opportunity.   In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this  country as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign  account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of  transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will  require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin  with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign  account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his  request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the  correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from  to your own designation bank account.   I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On  smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the  total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of  expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and  internet bills, while 60% will be for me and my coleagues. Please, you have  been adviced to keep ""Top Secret"" as I am still in service and intend to  retire from service after we conclude this deal with you.   I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm  the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for  subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated  and further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us  to invest in.

legitimate,phishing,True,"[R] replicates in repeated ANOVA Hi,  I have sort of a newbie question. I've seriously put a lot of effort into how to handle simple replicates in a repeated ANOVA design, but haven't had much luck.  I really liked reading ""Notes on the use of R for psychology experiments and questionnaires"", by Jonathan Baron and Yuelin Li ( http://www.psych.upenn.edu/~baron/rpsych/rpsych.html ) but still didn't run across an example using simple replicates. So, I made up the data below semi-borrowing the idea of a reaction time experiment involving noise from Maxwell, S. E. & Delaney, H. D. (1990) Designing Experiments and Analyzing Data: A model comparison perspective. Pacific Grove, CA: Brooks/Cole., which was referenced in the Baron and Li link above. The experimental concept I'm trying to envision is 2 groups of subjects (Treat and Control), 3 subjects in each.  In one session, all 6 patients from both groups are tested for reaction time by making 3 replicate tests on some hypothetical RT test (I call this the ""pre"" testing phase below or one could call this baseline ).  In a second session (the ""post"" phase), the subjects in the ""Treat"" Group are subjected to noise (or any treatment), while the other 3 ""Control"" subjects are not, (i.e. the Control subjects are basically tested exactly like they were in the ""pre"" testing session). I'm trying to set up the correct model for this experimental design to simply understand whether ""noise"" (or treatment) has an effect on reaction time.  Can someone tell this newbie the proper name of this experimental design? By setting up the design this way, I'm hoping one could see if there was a ""pre"" session to ""post"" session effect (using the Control group) and then take into account any possible pre->post effect when deciding whether there was a Treatment (noise) effect.   Unfortunately, whenever, I put the Group factor in the Error term (to take into account subj:Group as a random effect), I get a singular result: (see the data entry section below)         > rt.aov <- aov(rt ~ Group*prepost + Error(subj/(prepost*Group)), data=rt.df)         Warning message:         Error() model is singular in: aov(rt ~ Group * prepost + Error(subj/(prepost * Group)), data = rt.df)  plus, I'm not sure how to include the replicate factor (""rep"") in my Error() term -- should it be something like  ...+Error(subj*rep/(Group*prepost))?             (this still gives the above error if Group is in the error term, but I'm pretty sure it should be there since all interactions given the individual subject are random effects, aren't they?)

legitimate,phishing,True,"You Did a Good Job Dear Mr. Lay:  In this trying time of second-guesses and angry shareholders, I wanted to let you know that I have appreciated working for you and share a quick story of how you shaped my view of Enron and the corporate world in general.  My second rotation as an associate was to write speeches for the Office of the Chairman.  Generally, I was creating presentations for Jeff Skilling, but I did create a couple for you as well.  The one I remember best was for the speech at Astro Hall for the Houston Energy Conference where we announced Enron Online.  Not only did you let me lead the internal roundtable (I remember sitting at the table, trying to keep my composure as Greg Whalley, Dan Leff, Louise Kitchen and others asked specifics about the slides I created), but you also (generally) agreed with my answers and thanked me for a job well done.  That night, I shared a bottle of champagne with my wife and truly believed I could do anything!!  So, as far as I am concerned, you have done a tremendous job.  Everything happening now is unfortunate.  It happened on your watch and thus is partly your responsibility.  But you have stepped up to the plate, most likely saved more jobs than lost, and been accountable in more ways than one.  Being a leader in good times and in bad, and more importantly affecting the lives of your employees on a personal basis, are truly attributes that I hope to continue in my lifetime.  I just wanted you to know that you have truly made a difference in one man's career.  And I feel all the better for it.  My prayers go to you and your family.

legitimate,phishing,True,"Why spam isn't going away soon    CNET | Security Center                March 3, 2008     View online | Manage newsletters | Unsubscribe | Send us feedback                Why spam isn't going away soon         Recently, Symantec said in its February 2008 State of Spam report that 78.5 percent of all e-mail is spam. They also said most of that is now coming from Europe. That's a change from previous reports that had suggested servers in North America were responsible. What the Symantec report doesn't explicitly state is that much of the European spam doesn't come from individuals sitting at their desk pumping out lists. Europe is one of the hotbeds for the Storm worm botnet, notorious for automatically co-opting its victims into spam relays. For example, with the release of a Valentine's Day theme-spam barrage in early February,  Jose Nazario of Arbor Networks estimated that Storm has grown by as much as 50 percent in new infections. More ominous, Nazario says ""the fact (Storm) is generating lots of money means that it's in (the creator's) interests to keep grooming it, keep growing it."" Worse Storm isn't the only big, bad botnet in town. Read more Security Bites podcast CNET Security Center Security Watch archive   Robert VamosiCNET.com       Latest forum discussions  What is...

New plant  plus significantly reduced summer demand through conservation has put the  West's capacity margin at 15 percent, but regional balances vary widely. Power  demand declines have also completely relieved the West Coast gas supply  shortfall. Despite low hydroelectric output, gas demand for power generation in  the West is actually down from last year.  *  Energy conservation in response to the retail price increase, cool weather,  and the slowing economy is the strongest fundamental driver in California.   *  New power supplies have arrived, but grid operators cannot count on full  nameplate capacity within the first few months of a new plant's start date.  *  Pacific Northwest hydroelectric resources remain critically low despite low  demand, raising the specter of reliability problems this winter.  **end**  Follow above URL for complete Monthly Briefing (9 printed pages).

legitimate,phishing,True,"Assessing the post September 11 Landscape: CERA's New Global Energy Initiative Assessing the post September 11 Landscape: CERA's New Global Energy Initiative  The uncertainties created by the attack on September 11 and the global response have created turmoil for near-term energy planning and investment decision making. Circumstances demand rapid reassessments of near-term risks and strategies. In response to client requests, CERA is undertaking a comprehensive, new initiative to develop a framework for understanding potential energy futures and their implications.  This special multiclient project will include interactive analyses, face-to-face workshops, and real-time updates. It will draw on CERA's broad industry and regional expertise, offering participants both a framework and a robust tool for evaluating strategies across all sectors of the energy business and all geographies. The focus will be on creating new and highly relevant insights into the energy future and the political and economic context. It will highlight both key trends and probable discontinuities -- and assess urgent issues in a setting that will promote thoughtful and informed dialogue.  By emphasizing both virtual and in-person exchanges among participating members and CERA experts, we will establish a three-year road map for decision makers across the energy business, to complement CERA's industry-specific and shorter-term analyses. In addition, the process will offer a unique opportunity to interact with others across the energy spectrum and to share ideas and experiences.  * Could the economic slowdown be prolonged and inflation be rekindled? * What is the impact on energy demand -- does the fuel mix shift? * How great are the risks for disruptions of supply? In which countries and for which fuels? * How would disruptions play out?  And how tumultuous will they be for energy companies? * How will energy policies change -- relative to energy security, environmental trade-offs, and fuel strategies? * Will the global coalition hold, or are we moving to a more divided and more fractured world? * How profound will be the changes for the energy business?  This timely series provides a three-year horizon that draws on the framework established in CERA's longer-term scenarios. It uses the clash between the ""Fragmentation"" and ""Globality"" scenarios as the starting point for assessing the new world in which energy-decision makers will operate and the critical choices they will face.  The first workshop will be held in Houston on November 15, in conjunction with CERA's Fall Roundtable series.  Additional workshops, both in Houston and other cities and via online technologies, will follow. We will announce the entire schedule, with events and deliverables, soon. The process will deliver a clear framework for anticipating the future, and conclusions for energy strategy.

phishing,legitimate,True,"CONFIDENTIAL DR.TUNJI OWO Zenith Bank Ltd,Lagos,Nigeria, Private Tel:234-80-2354-6330.  Dear Friend, I am DR.TUNJI OWO.The Manager Zenith Bank, Lagos, Nigeria.  I have urgent and-ery confidential business proposition for you. On April 6, 1996, a Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr.Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for some months, valued at S$29,500,000.00 (Twenty Nine Million Five hundred Thousand Dollars only) in my branch. Upon maturity,I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month,we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers,the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Barry Kelly died on 1 February 1997 in a plane crash on air senegal on aircraft Name Hawker Siddeley HS-748. This crash happened in Tambacoumba, Senegal, Africa and the registration  number of the aircraft is 6AV-AEO, and since his untimely death the funds has been dormant in his account with my Bank without any claim of the fund On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$29,500,000.00 has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for safe-keeping.No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law,at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as an Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money I deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes though the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as I tagged them to be photographic materials for export.   am writing you because I as a public servant, we can not operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than $1m.I want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney.All these are to make sure that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney willprepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the as the owner of the boxes. The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 25% for you and 5% will take care of all expenses.There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantee the successful execution of this transaction. f you are interested, please reply immediately via my email address. upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe with utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. REGARDS. DR.TUNJI OWO.",1

It has been evident for a while now that the prices for foward months would be going down, but this is the first day I'm hearing that ProCaribe wants revised invoices.  It doesn't need to be said that cash forecasting is very important to Enron at this time and based on previous conversations, I had confirmed to the forecasting group that they would receive the funds today.  The revised invoices will be issued tomorrow.  I need confirmation that the payment of the balance due will be made tomorrow, without fail.  Per my calculations, balance due would be $1,406,580.96 taking into account the $1,000,00.00 payment that was made today.  Please confirm.

Email:clicfwanton@rixmail.se    Dear Friend,    It is with trust and confidence that I write to reveal this urgent  business relationship to you. I was assigned by two of my colleagues to  seek for a foreign partner who will assist us in providing a convenient  account in a designated bank overseas for the transfer of US$32,000,  000.00 (Thirty Two Million United States Dollars Only) pending our  arrival in your country for utilization and disbursement of the fund  with the owner of the account where the fund would be transferred  into.    On the 23rd of January 1996, our corporation, the Nigeria National  Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) awarded a contract of $120,000,000.00 (  One Hundred and Twenty Million United States Dollars) but I and my  colleagues being members of the contract award committee inflated the  contract sum to the tune of US$152,000, 000.00 with the intention of  sharing the remaining balance of US$32,000,000.00 among ourselves.    The contract has been successfully executed and the actual contractors  have been paid their US$120,000,000.00 ( One Hundred and Twenty Million  United States Dollars) in full. But what we want to transfer out of the  country in our favour for disbursement is US$32M. balance My colleagues  and I have agreed that if you / your company can act as the beneficiary  of this fund , we will transfer the funds to your account and you will  retain 30% of the total fund for assistance rendered, while we will  retain 60% of the total fund and the balance of 10% of the fund will be  set aside for the offsetting of all expenses that might be incurredby  both parties during the fund transfer process.

""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stret! ch! . Trent Dilfer , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point. Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 10/23/01 Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck fr! om! a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week. Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 10/23/01 The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams. Dedric Ward , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season. Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Neal/McKay Updated 10/23/01 Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week. Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week. Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Tori U! pd! ated 10/23/01 Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use him this week. Terrence Wilkins , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week. Terrell Davis , RB DEN - JWillie Updated 10/23/01 Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they will activate h! im! . He will work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Martin Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice until late in the week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota.  Duce Staley , RB PHI - Giggles Updated 10/23/01 Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on 11 carries l! at! e in the game. At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a solid replacement.  Joe Nedney , K TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week.  Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Kinney will be listed on the injury report because of a calf injury. However, he is expected to play in this week's game.  Kevin Dyson , WR TEN - Bass/Hull Updated 10/23/01 Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice. Eddie George , RB TEN - Tori Updated 10/23/01 George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in this week's game.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Martin Updated 10/23/01 McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game.  Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence.  Damon Jones , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery.  Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Martin Updated 10/23/01 Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's game remains uncertain. ""All I know is that, from week to week, they increase his exercises and change of direction,"" head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. ""It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week."" Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23.  Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to action next week.  Todd Heap , TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle.  Terry Allen , RB BAL - Tori Updated 10/23/01 Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at running back if Allen is inactive.  Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Tori Updated 10/23/01 Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. ""I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest area,"" Grbac said Monday. ""There could be something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see."" Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unable to play.  Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Neal/McKay Updated 10/23/01 Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orleans.  Trung Canidate , RB STL - Giggles Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. ""I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game,"" coach Mike Martz said. ""He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play."" Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week.  J.J. Stokes , WR SF - Matty Updated 10/23/01 Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close to being completely healthy. ""Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was a blessing for me because I was ab! le! to get treatment every day,"" Stokes told the Contra Costa Times . ""I practiced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close."" Stokes has been less than mediocre, however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to be more reliable.  Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - Russell Updated 10/23/01 Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants' starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed.  Ron Dixon , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day.  Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Matty Updated 10/23/01 According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. ""I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago,"" Martz said. ""I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play."" Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to go.

For example, it is my understanding that there are 4 WO set up for Red Rock - one for each station to be modified.  Our work is of a general nature, so do we have to further subdivide our charges to each of the stations, or to three of the stations.  Also, some of our time is spent on a general analysis of regulatory strategy involving all capital projects, and it seems like the overhead WO would be appropriate for these charges.  We don't necessarily want to have to have each person charge to 3 or 4 WO for each identifiable capital project and then to 10 or more WO for our general work.

The paper is available on the Publications page of my website, www.EHirst.com << File: http://www.ehirst.com/ >> . Please let me know if you have any comments on the paper. Here is a summary of the paper:         California was supposed to show the rest of the nation a brighter electricity future. That future, as outlined by the California Public Utilities Commission in 1994, envisioned an electricity industry featuring competitive markets. Such markets were intended to produce lower costs and more choices for consumers, while ensuring profits for efficient energy suppliers and encouraging the retirement of old, inefficient power plants.         Although the first two years of restructuring (beginning in April 1998) seemed to bear out these promises, the last year has been a disaster for California's electricity consumers, taxpayers, and electric utilities. Part of the fallout from California's electricity crisis is considerable concern-even opposition-in other states to restructuring the electricity industry.          Although a few states have decided, based on the California experience, not to restructure, I believe that is the wrong outcome. Instead, the primary lessons other states should learn from California are that competitive markets can work; competition is not to blame for California's problems; and basic economic principles of supply, demand, and prices affect market outcomes.         Section 2 of this paper briefly reviews the history of electricity regulation and restructuring in California and the problems that occurred beginning in May 2000. Section 3, the heart of this paper, offers guidance to other states on the key ingredients of a competitive electricity industry. This section makes several points:   Maintain a favorable investment and regulatory climate for new generation to ensure that enough generation capacity is online and planned to meet growing loads.   Ensure that enough infrastructure (transmission capacity and natural gas pipeline capacity) is in place and planned to meet growing loads, maintain reliability, connect new generators to the grid, support large regional markets, and provide fuel to power plants.   Encourage retail customers to participate in dynamic-pricing and voluntary-load-reduction programs (i.e., couple retail and wholesale markets).   Create honest retail competition: avoid standard-offer rates with artificial discounts and create conditions that encourage many companies to offer retail services without favoring individual competitors.   Encourage electricity suppliers to manage and diversify their supply and price risks.   Create efficient and integrated wholesale markets for energy, ancillary services, and transmission congestion.   Monitor and minimize horizontal market power (generation) and vertical market power (combined ownership and operation of generation and transmission).           Ultimately, competitive markets for electricity will lower costs and prices, better align consumer prices with producer costs, improve producer efficiency in both investment and operation, maintain or improve reliability, and yield greater innovation in customer services and pricing options.          But, this transition from one industry structure to another is turning out to be long and complicated. It is complicated because electricity is so important to our modern, high-tech society; electricity is our most flexible fuel, providing light, heat, motive power, and the energy to operate all our electronic equipment. Also, electricity truly is a real-time product for which production and consumption must occur at the same time.          Although the problems that have occurred in California are substantial and worrisome, regulators and legislators in other states should focus on the long-term benefits of competitive electricity markets and accept the possible short-term problems that may occur. They also need to recognize that wholesale markets are regional in scope and extend far beyond the boundaries of any single state. Finally, competition in retail and wholesale markets must be coordinated; in particular, it is not possible to have competitive wholesale markets unless at least some retail load faces time varying prices.          If states restructure properly to create competitive markets for wholesale energy and retail services, we should all benefit. Consumers will enjoy lower prices, they will have many more choices of energy services and price-risk tradeoffs, reliability will be improved because most reliability services will be obtained through markets instead of by engineering edict, and the financial risks associated with building and operating power plants will be assigned properly to investors rather than consumers.

To customize, reschedule, or turn off these reports please click here  Player Updates NFL Reports 	    Latest NFL Player News Ricky Watters , RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 According to the Tacoma News Tribune, Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. ""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stret! ch! . Trent Dilfer , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point. Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 10/23/01 Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck fr! om! a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week. Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 10/23/01 The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams. Dedric Ward , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season. Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Neal/McKay Updated 10/23/01 Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week. Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week. Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Tori U! pd! ated 10/23/01 Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use him this week. Terrence Wilkins , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week. Terrell Davis , RB DEN - JWillie Updated 10/23/01 Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they will activate h! im! . He will work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Martin Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice until late in the week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota.  Duce Staley , RB PHI - Giggles Updated 10/23/01 Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on 11 carries l! at! e in the game. At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a solid replacement.  Joe Nedney , K TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week.  Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Kinney will be listed on the injury report because of a calf injury. However, he is expected to play in this week's game.  Kevin Dyson , WR TEN - Bass/Hull Updated 10/23/01 Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice. Eddie George , RB TEN - Tori Updated 10/23/01 George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in this week's game.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Martin Updated 10/23/01 McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game.  Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence.  Damon Jones , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery.  Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Martin Updated 10/23/01 Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's game remains uncertain. ""All I know is that, from week to week, they increase his exercises and change of direction,"" head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. ""It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week."" Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23.  Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to action next week.  Todd Heap , TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle.  Terry Allen , RB BAL - Tori Updated 10/23/01 Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at running back if Allen is inactive.  Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Tori Updated 10/23/01 Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. ""I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest area,"" Grbac said Monday. ""There could be something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see."" Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unable to play.  Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Neal/McKay Updated 10/23/01 Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orleans.  Trung Canidate , RB STL - Giggles Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. ""I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game,"" coach Mike Martz said. ""He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play."" Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week.  J.J. Stokes , WR SF - Matty Updated 10/23/01 Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close to being completely healthy. ""Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was a blessing for me because I was ab! le! to get treatment every day,"" Stokes told the Contra Costa Times . ""I practiced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close."" Stokes has been less than mediocre, however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to be more reliable.  Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - Russell Updated 10/23/01 Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants' starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed.  Ron Dixon , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day.  Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Matty Updated 10/23/01 According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. ""I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago,"" Martz said. ""I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play."" Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to go.

While games programs have been engineered for efficiency from the early days, high-performance planners are a relatively recent development.  Both planning and games are important fields of research in the Artificial Intelligence community. A trend in the computer game community, exemplified in initiatives such as the General Game Playing Project and ORTS, has been on playing whole classes of games, and on increasing realism and complexity. This tests the limits of traditional game-tree search approaches. However, the planning community has a lot of experience in dealing with huge search spaces. Furthermore, such games also involve current topics of much current interest in planning, such as: time reasoning, resource management, imperfect information, cost-based planning, etc.  This workshop will discuss all aspects of using planning in the domain of games. Relevant topics include, but are not limited to:  - planning techniques for classical games - planning in commercial computer games - integration of planning and game tree search - representational issues: languages for planning in games - opportunities for technology transfer between the communities - competitions - planning stories and scenarios - planning and interactive narrative - integrating planning and affective systems - planning for NPCs - dialogue planning - reasoning about actions and game playing - plan recognition - learning plans  Important Dates: ================  Submission Deadline (extended):    June 25, 2007    11:59pm PST (Samoa time UTC-11)  Notifications and Technical Program:    July 13, 2007  Camera-Ready Paper Submissions:    July 31, 2007  Workshop Date:    September 23, 2007  Submission Procedure: =====================  We ask authors to submit technical papers in PDF format. Papers should be formatted in accordance with the AAAI style template and may be at most 8 pages long, including figures and bibliography. Visit the url http://www.aaai.org/Publications/Author/author.php for formatting instructions.

Now, in the continuing economic    downturn,  foreign  workers  are  being  blamed  for  displacing their    homegrown counterparts.     Wednesday,  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., will introduce a bill crafted    to  close  loopholes  in  employment  visa  laws,  which he says allow    companies  to  hire  foreign  employees  and  outsource  them to other    companies.     ADVERTISEMENT     IFRAME:    http://ad.doubleclick.net/adi/eweek.dart/news;sz=336x280;ord=456641793    3?    [news;abr=!ie;sz=336x280;ord=4566417933?]      [ew_spacer.gif]     ""We must make sure that our immigration policies don't have a backlash    effect  on displacing American workers,"" Chambliss said Tuesday. ""[The    bill]  will  end the practice of companies who are displacing American    workers.""     The  Senate  Judiciary  Committee  Tuesday  took a look at the role of    temporary work visas in the current economy. The technology industry's    use  of  H-1B  visas  dropped approximately 75 percent last year, with    initial  H-1B visa applications falling to 26,659 in 2002 from 105,692    in  2001,  according  to the Department of Homeland Security Office of    Immigration Security.     Despite  the  statistics,  as unemployment rises in the United States,    lawmakers are hearing from their constituents.     ""I  cannot  tell  you  how  many  workers  came up to me [in August in    California]  and  said, 'I've been replaced by somebody I trained, and    they're  getting  a  third  [the  salary] of what I got,'"" Sen. Dianne    Feinstein,  D-Calif.,  said  at  a  hearing  of  the  Senate Judiciary    Committee  Tuesday. ""Wherever I go, this program comes up and somebody    tells me they've been replaced, and they are angry.""     Intel  Corp.,  which  employs close to 80,000 workers worldwide, hires    individuals  through  the  H1-B  visa program when a position requires    unique  or  difficult-to-find  skills,  Patrick Duffy, human resources    attorney  at Intel, told lawmakers. Beginning in 2001, Intel decreased    hiring  overall,  but  it  continues  to  hire H-1B applicants when it    cannot  find  qualified  U.S.  workers,  Duffy  said.  The company has    particular difficulty hiring U.S. citizens for positions in electrical    engineering design and chemical engineering, he said.     Duffy  contended  that  the  H-1B  visa program does not displace U.S.    workers  and  ultimately  benefits  the  U.S.  economy.  Most  of  the    company's  H-1B visa employees studied at U.S. universities and earned    masters degrees and doctorates.     ""These are not temporary workers to us. The H-1B visa is just one step    in  making these workers U.S. workers,"" Duffy said. ""Hopefully they'll    stay with Intel ... the rest of their lives.""     Large  corporations  that  rely  on skilled foreign workers are urging    Congress  not  to pass short-term fixes that will later cause problems    when  the  economy  recovers.  In  the  boom  times  of the late '90s,    Ingersoll-Rand  Corp. had to take people off the payroll when the H-1B    hiring  cap  was  lowered,  Elizabeth Dickson, adviser for Immigration    Services  at  Ingersoll-Rand  in  Woodcliff Lake, N.J., told lawmakers    Tuesday.     ""When  the [foreign worker hiring] cap reverts to 65,000, we are going    to  have a lot of problems that we experienced both in 1997 and 1998,""    Dickson  said.  ""If  we  have a recovering economy, what are our needs    going to be long term?""     The  root of the problem, according to the industry officials, is that    Americans  earn too few graduate degrees in the hard sciences, leaving    the  domestic  pool of adequate engineering specializations too small.    Contrary  to some assertions, industry officials said they do not hire    foreign  workers  to  pay  them  less  than  they would pay Americans.    Dickson  told  lawmakers  that  it  is  more expensive to hire foreign    workers.     ""We  are  mostly  looking  to  hire U.S. workers. They're cheaper, and    there  are  a  lot  less problems,"" Dickson said. ""In the near term we    simply must have access to foreign nationals. If we want to maintain a    global edge, we want to have the best and the brightest working for us    in the United States.""     American  engineers  argue  that corporate America's use of H-1B visas    exacerbates the problem of engineering unemployment. Abuse of the visa    program,  in  particular,  leaves  qualified  Americans  out  of work,    according  to  John  Steadman,  president-elect  of  the  IEEE-USA  in    Washington, D.C.     ""If  we  continue  down  this path, the United States is making itself    increasingly  dependent  of foreign technical expertise, both here and    abroad,""  Steadman  told  lawmakers,  urging the government to support    programs  that  encourage  more  students--especially  minorities  and    women--to go into the sciences.",0

legitimate,phishing,True,"Flushed pending centeris patch queue -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA1  Hey guys,  I've pushed out all my pending patches for winbindd except:  (a) security = ads & machine password change in winbindd (b) username map support for winbindd  Since these might possibly require some discussion and general agreement, I'll post patches to the list here.  The major merges are  1.  Maintaining the full trust topology (including transitive     trusts).  These should be accessed by child processes     using the wcache_tdc_xxx() functions.  2.  Support for one-way trusts  3.  Working offline logons with remote idmap backends  4.  Updated set_dc_and_flags() functionality based on trust     information from our primary domain.  This means we     should be able to avoid contacting remote domains     (inside our forest).  There's other minor fixes.  I tried to break the commits up into manage chunks (about 30 I think).  All of this is working in my local tree but I'll spend a good bit of time testing tomorrow and make sure I haven't introduced any regressions.  Might take a day or so to stabilize.      cheers, jerry -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1.4.3 (GNU/Linux) Comment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org  iD8DBQFGPlieIR7qMdg1EfYRAo0eAKCmjNX17wgQPAxBjvHLjSqmUwXnZACfeYlF lIt/uKM04MdZegAy+sdgqik= =Vv50 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----",0

Now, in the continuing economic    downturn,  foreign  workers  are  being  blamed  for  displacing their    homegrown counterparts.     Wednesday,  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., will introduce a bill crafted    to  close  loopholes  in  employment  visa  laws,  which he says allow    companies  to  hire  foreign  employees  and  outsource  them to other    companies.     ADVERTISEMENT     IFRAME:    http://ad.doubleclick.net/adi/eweek.dart/news;sz=336x280;ord=456641793    3?    [news;abr=!ie;sz=336x280;ord=4566417933?]      [ew_spacer.gif]     ""We must make sure that our immigration policies don't have a backlash    effect  on displacing American workers,"" Chambliss said Tuesday. ""[The    bill]  will  end the practice of companies who are displacing American    workers.""     The  Senate  Judiciary  Committee  Tuesday  took a look at the role of    temporary work visas in the current economy. The technology industry's    use  of  H-1B  visas  dropped approximately 75 percent last year, with    initial  H-1B visa applications falling to 26,659 in 2002 from 105,692    in  2001,  according  to the Department of Homeland Security Office of    Immigration Security.     Despite  the  statistics,  as unemployment rises in the United States,    lawmakers are hearing from their constituents.     ""I  cannot  tell  you  how  many  workers  came up to me [in August in    California]  and  said, 'I've been replaced by somebody I trained, and    they're  getting  a  third  [the  salary] of what I got,'"" Sen. Dianne    Feinstein,  D-Calif.,  said  at  a  hearing  of  the  Senate Judiciary    Committee  Tuesday. ""Wherever I go, this program comes up and somebody    tells me they've been replaced, and they are angry.""     Intel  Corp.,  which  employs close to 80,000 workers worldwide, hires    individuals  through  the  H1-B  visa program when a position requires    unique  or  difficult-to-find  skills,  Patrick Duffy, human resources    attorney  at Intel, told lawmakers. Beginning in 2001, Intel decreased    hiring  overall,  but  it  continues  to  hire H-1B applicants when it    cannot  find  qualified  U.S.  workers,  Duffy  said.  The company has    particular difficulty hiring U.S. citizens for positions in electrical    engineering design and chemical engineering, he said.     Duffy  contended  that  the  H-1B  visa program does not displace U.S.    workers  and  ultimately  benefits  the  U.S.  economy.  Most  of  the    company's  H-1B visa employees studied at U.S. universities and earned    masters degrees and doctorates.     ""These are not temporary workers to us. The H-1B visa is just one step    in  making these workers U.S. workers,"" Duffy said. ""Hopefully they'll    stay with Intel ... the rest of their lives.""     Large  corporations  that  rely  on skilled foreign workers are urging    Congress  not  to pass short-term fixes that will later cause problems    when  the  economy  recovers.  In  the  boom  times  of the late '90s,    Ingersoll-Rand  Corp. had to take people off the payroll when the H-1B    hiring  cap  was  lowered,  Elizabeth Dickson, adviser for Immigration    Services  at  Ingersoll-Rand  in  Woodcliff Lake, N.J., told lawmakers    Tuesday.     ""When  the [foreign worker hiring] cap reverts to 65,000, we are going    to  have a lot of problems that we experienced both in 1997 and 1998,""    Dickson  said.  ""If  we  have a recovering economy, what are our needs    going to be long term?""     The  root of the problem, according to the industry officials, is that    Americans  earn too few graduate degrees in the hard sciences, leaving    the  domestic  pool of adequate engineering specializations too small.    Contrary  to some assertions, industry officials said they do not hire    foreign  workers  to  pay  them  less  than  they would pay Americans.    Dickson  told  lawmakers  that  it  is  more expensive to hire foreign    workers.     ""We  are  mostly  looking  to  hire U.S. workers. They're cheaper, and    there  are  a  lot  less problems,"" Dickson said. ""In the near term we    simply must have access to foreign nationals. If we want to maintain a    global edge, we want to have the best and the brightest working for us    in the United States.""     American  engineers  argue  that corporate America's use of H-1B visas    exacerbates the problem of engineering unemployment. Abuse of the visa    program,  in  particular,  leaves  qualified  Americans  out  of work,    according  to  John  Steadman,  president-elect  of  the  IEEE-USA  in    Washington, D.C.     ""If  we  continue  down  this path, the United States is making itself    increasingly  dependent  of foreign technical expertise, both here and    abroad,""  Steadman  told  lawmakers,  urging the government to support    programs  that  encourage  more  students--especially  minorities  and    women--to go into the sciences.",0
legitimate,phishing,True,"re : transitional assignments all i have received a few notes about this since this one but i will try to respond to all questions here . please see below responses in red : enron capital sally - husband and 3 children - ages 15 , 11 and 2 ) . i understand that the houses which have been vacated due to returning expats have all been filled , so can you have someone arrange for corporate housing that will accommodate them ? i think the best way to go here is for us to use serviced apartments as it will be very difficult to find a lease for such a short period for this type of accommodation . my assistant , lisa , has put a call in to a service who can help us find serviced accommodation in south kensington / chelsea area or in dolphin square where we have people now who are very satisfied . is there a reason you are partial to south kensington / chelsea ? what if we find accommodation in another nice area of london within a short commute to the office ? when i have some options , i will let you know , probably on monday . immigration - due to the fact that they will be traveling back and forth and have made trips already , i feel it would be best to apply for work permits versus using the visa waiver . i have sent them the forms and requested that brent complete his and file immediately to increase chances of getting his sometime shortly after he arrives in the uk . i have informed him that he should arrive without his family if the permit has not been received by april 1 . brent ' s work permit will be submitted today and we may receive if before april lst , but it is unlikely . the way it works for this is as follows : brent will receive the work permit from us and if he is here , he will have to leave the uk and enter with the work permit for it to be validated . if his family are in houston , they will need to receive entry clearance in the us prior to arriving in the uk . this takes approx 7 working days and they will require either brent ' s original passport and work permit or a certified copy of each along with other things such as marriage and birth certificates . if brent decides to bring his family with him to london prior to receiving the work permit , they must say they are coming on a vacation for a short period of time and have a return ticket to back it up . once the permit is received , the family can either travel back to houston and submit the entry clearance visas there or they can all travel to amsterdam where they are currenlty issuing entry clearance without a problem . there is always a small element of risk in going to amsterdam , however , as do not have to issue the stamps there , they just do it because they are nice ! work permits are arriving approx 4 weeks from date of submission . we can discuss all of this on the 20 th . tax - please confirm whether paye will need to be paid for them during the short term assignment and then reclaimed through a treaty benefit . paye is due after 60 days ; however , if brent and sally are really only going to be here for approx 75 days , i am not going to inform the revenue that they are here . if this extends beyond the set time , we can look at options but the only responsiblility that brent and sally will have is to ensure they complete the tax organiser in order for us to get the tax back . also , as we would have to apply the treaty here , we need to ensure the salary costs stay in houston . jane , have you discussed this point ? benefits - i have suggested that they remain on us domestic payroll and benefits and , if medical claims arise that exceed what they would have spent in the us , they may claim the excess on the expense report . agreed . per diem - we need to discuss the appropriate amount based on family size . jane , please call me to discuss . i have left you a message , thanks let me know of any other issues we need to address . as always , i appreciate your help . jane",0

legitimate,phishing,True,"Cabot Wealth Advisiory 7/5/07 - TV, Intelligence and More July 5, 2007  Salem, Massachusetts  By Timothy Lutts  -----  There's Nothing On!  The SAT Measures What?  A Company With Predictive Decisioning Software  -----  My wife recently attended a conference in upstate New York and one night found herself back in her hotel room, turning to the television for entertainment.  Now, in our family, real-time network television is a rare event.    Thanks to Replay TV, a one-time competitor of TiVo in the DVR (digital video recorder) business, our favorite shows get recorded on a big hard disk and we watch them when we want, skipping the commercials as we go.  In fact, the only time we watch commercials is during the Super Bowl.  More often, we read.  In any event, there was my wife, in a New York state hotel room, ""forced"" to choose from a dreadful selection of real-time network TV offerings.  Of course she could have turned it off, but in that dull hotel room in that strange town, she was just searching for a little life, a little humor, a little intelligence.  What she got was bad TV, along with an onslaught of repetitive, often-insulting commercials.  So she called me, and somewhere along the way she asked, ""Why do people watch this garbage?  And why do the networks play the same commercials, sometimes several times during the same show?""  I couldn't give her an easy answer, but I did sympathize, and that's really what she wanted.  Soon after, I googled ""top ten TV shows,"" and here's what I found.  America's Got Talent Dateline NBC Deal or No Deal Law and Order N-C-I-S C-S-I Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader? Two and A Half Men So You Think You Can Dance? C-S-I Miami  I've never seen any of these, which goes to show you how out of touch I am.  But I do know (from reading) that four of them are crime dramas, two are talent searches, two are game shows, one is a sitcom and one is a news magazine that typically focuses on human-interest stories.  Reviewing this list, I'm reminded of the words of HL Mencken, who wrote, ""No one in this world, so far as I know, has ever lost money by underestimating the intelligence of the great masses of the plain people.""  Then, a few days ago one of my editors commented to me, no doubt after viewing one of the those headlines like ""Man Shoots Self in Groin While Attempting To Make Ham Sandwich,"" ""You know, half of Americans are of below average intelligence.""  Upon reflection, it's obvious.  And it's statistically inevitable.    The average is near the middle, so half will always be below the average (technically, below the median, but given the very large numbers we're dealing with, there's little difference.)  And if you don't know the difference between mean and median, you probably haven't crammed for an SAT test lately.  The converse, however, does not mean that if you do know the difference you have crammed for the test recently.  That's logic at work.  And the SAT, now that I've brought it up, is not what it used to be.  In 1901 it debuted as the Scholastic Achievement Test, supposedly measuring what students had learned.  In 1941, the name was changed to Scholastic Aptitude Test, supposedly measuring what students were capable of learning, if they had the proper socio-economic advantages.  In 1990, that was changed to Scholastic Assessment Test, supposedly measuring . . . something scholastic?  And in 1994 the name was changed to SAT (the letters officially standing for nothing at all!)  Finally (or, should I say, most recently, because I suspect there are more changes around the corner), in 2005 the name was changed to SAT Reasoning Test, creating a potential redundancy of the word ""Test"" but only if the first T still stood for Test, which it doesn't.  Reasoning, of course, includes logic, and I like that a lot. I hope they keep that name for a while.  Now, I took the SAT a few decades back.  Two of my kids have taken it and the third is likely to in a couple years.  But something else has changed over the decades besides the name.  In 1995 the yardstick for scoring was adjusted to account for the growing number of kids from less rigorous schools taking the test.  The reason?  The big bulge in the middle of the distribution curve, which had previously been centered at 400, had slipped down into the mid-300s.  To get the mid-point back up, the average verbal score was artificially increased by some 70 points while the average math score had 20-30 points added.  The kids at the top and bottom were barely affected, but the masses of average kids near the middle saw their scores bumped up dramatically.  What does it matter?  Well, a good score helps you get into college.    But is there a correlation between success on the SAT and success in college?  Looking further out, is there correlation between success on the SAT and success in life?  The simple answer is, some, but not a lot.  And more and more colleges are recognizing that; the number of colleges that admit students without regard to test scores now exceeds 400.  But the SAT lives on, and will continue to be here for years to come.  Why?  In part because it's the product of The College Board.    The College Board is a non-profit organization, and while there's no doubt that it works hard to serve the high schools and colleges and families that use it, there's even less doubt - in my mind - that the organization works even harder to ensure its own survival.   ----- ADVERTISEMENT -----  Join Cabot Stock of The Month and get in on the next stock that explodes like these...   * Broadvision-up 670%  * Intuitive Surgical-up 500%  * Yahoo-up 317%  * Amazon.com-up 1,290%  * First Marblehead-up 50%  * International Game Technology-up 110%  * eResearch Technology-up 180%  * NetEase-up 100%  * Expedia-up 114%  * Broadcom-up 97%  * Netflix-up 173%  * Psychiatric Solutions-up 85%  * PetroKazakhstan-up 86%  * Nautilus-up 109%  That's the beauty of Cabot Stock of the Month.

""A financial services firm in Japan has begun offering lower mortgage interest rates to ""intelligent"" customers.  GE Consumer Finance Company is giving discounts to people who have good English or computer skills, and work in ""high-value"" areas such as the law.  The company says more highly skilled workers usually find it easier than others to get jobs and to keep them. They are therefore less likely to become insolvent and default on their home loan.  GE Consumer Finance Company claims this is the first time that mortgage rates have been calculated like this in Japan.  People who have high scores on a test of English proficiency and officially certified IT skills can apply for a small discount.  Those of them who also have certain jobs - such as lawyers, accountants, doctors and financial experts - can obtain further discounts.  If a couple are both employed in the 20 ""high-value"" professions listed by the company, they will be entitled to a major rate reduction.""  It makes sense, and I'm guessing it's illegal to discriminate that way in the U.S.  -----  Getting back to TV, the problem is not just the quality of programming but the quantity of time people spend viewing.  The TV is on for over 7 hours in the average American home, and the average American watches over 4 hours of TV per day.  Worse still, the average American child watches 1,023 hours of TV a year and spends 900 hours in school.  And one thing they're seeing in those hours is commercials.  For broadcast TV, commercials pay the bills, and the advertisers are doing all they can to ensure that the message from those commercials reaches your brain.  But more and more these days, people are working to avoid those commercials by fast-forwarding through them using DVRs.  So NBC recently tested people to see if those commercials had any impact at high-speed.  NBC, you know, wants its advertisers' money even if viewers are watching at fast speeds.  The result, according to a story three days ago in The New York Times, ""judging from the biological reactions, the test subjects were just as engaged while watching fast-forwarded advertisements as they were while viewing opening scenes from the NBC show ""Heroes"" at regular speed.""  When it comes to fast-forward advertisements, ""the assumption has always been that they have no economic value, that they have no communication value,"" said Alan Wurtzel, president for research at NBC Universal. ""But the fact of the matter is we're learning that they are valuable.""  And they're so ""valuable"" to the financial health of the TV industry that the commercial-skipping DVR that I bought years ago can no longer be bought!  But the problem is not just the commercials.  The problem is that every minute spent watching TV is a minute not being used to reflect, to do something productive, or to interact with other family members.  And the result of all this TV viewing, according to a recent study by the Culture and Media Institute, is that ""increased exposure to television correlates with a decline in acceptance of personal responsibility.""  Now, it's important to note that the word correlate was used there.    Officially, there's no established causality.  But my sense is that our country has seen a marked decrease in a sense of personal responsibility; that too many people all too easily blame others for their troubles.  And when personal responsibility shrinks, we get a culture that thinks it's okay to act stupid because somebody else will pick up the tab.  ----- Contest -----  Now, there is an investment idea coming here, but first I want to give a reward to a loyal reader who has chosen to read this far.

Do it now.  -----  And now, finally, here we are at today's stock.  It's about intelligence and it's about marketing, and if you understand how important marketing is to the world, you may like this one enough to invest in it.  You know and I know that at every turn, companies are doing their darndest to sell us things.  At Amazon they know what I've bought before and thus know what to sell me next.  And at Netflix they know what movies I've rated highly so they can suggest other movies they think I'd enjoy.  Those two firms have developed specialized software that serves their individual needs, but for most companies, there's off-the-shelf software that works very well, and a lot of it is coming from a company named Chordiant.  Here's what we wrote in a recent issue of Cabot Top Ten Report.  ""Chordiant (CHRD) makes customer service and marketing software that helps big companies deal with their customers, so that the goals of both the merchant and the customer are met. Customers include 21st Century Insurance, Bank of Ireland, Banque Populaire, Barclays, Capital One, Covad Communications, Cox Communications, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Lloyds, MetLife, Nokia, Prudential, Royal Bank of Scotland, Royal Dutch Shell, Time Warner Cable, T-Mobile, UPS and Wachovia. These are huge blue-chip companies, yet Chordiant is still a small company, and growing fast. Historically, the company has had trouble making a profit (its last profitable year was 2004), but after the first quarter's terrific results, CEO Steven R. Springsteel commented that solid profitability was ""due to the strong performance in our international business, the acceleration of percentage of completion project implementations in Europe, and greater enablement of our partners resulting in fewer Chordiant resources being required on some project implementations."" It sounds good to us. Since then the company has been awarded a patent for ""advanced predictive decisioning technology."" In other words, the companies using this software sometimes know what you're going to buy before you do! As companies come to depend on this software, Chordiant's future is likely to be consistently profitable, and the realization of that is why the stock is strong today.""  Digging deeper, I see that Chordiant has been growing revenues since 2003, and in the latest quarter saw revenues grow 25% from the year before to $32.8 million, while earnings jumped from a penny per share to $0.18 per share.  Analysts are projecting a profit of $0.48 per share this year and $0.72 per share next year.  And the after-tax profit margin was a fat 19.6%.  Trading at 16, it's rather low-priced and thus carries the extra risk of volatility that comes from stocks at this level.   But average trading volume is nearly 500,000 shares per day, and institutional interest is growing.  I'd like it better on a dip to 15, but if it doesn't dip there in the week ahead, 16 may be the best price you'll get.  -----  Editor's note:  To get regular updates on Chordiant, and to get first notice of other hot stocks, consider a no-risk trial subscription to Cabot Top Ten Report.

This blew me away: in Barack's victory in Virginia last night, he won 142,000  more votes than all of the Republicans combined, and his victory margin over  Senator Clinton was larger than John McCain's entire vote total. All of this,  in what the Old Guard liked to pretend was ""red state"" Virginia.  When Barack and I rode together in the motorcade in Charleston, South Carolina  on the day I gave him my endorsement, we talked about the three-million-member- strong johnkerry.com community. We both agreed that this email list was a  community of supporters, not an ATM machine.  And so these last weeks, as I've talked with you, as Barack introduced himself  to you, as Ted Kennedy talked about Barack's commitment to health care for all,  and Gov. Tim Kaine talked about Barack's ability to unite our country -- we  haven't asked you to dig into your pockets.  We've asked you to get to know  Barack, to study his positions, to make phone calls to your neighbors, to go  door to door -- to get involved.  But today, I ask you to consider making a contribution as the campaign enters a  new phase. Wisconsin, Texas, Ohio, Pennsylvania -- the next big contests in  this campaign are big media market states, huge states that are expensive to  build statewide field organizations in, and Barack has a lot of ground to make  up. To win, Barack can use all of our help.  Click here to donate what you can: http://click.email.johnkerry.com/?ju=fe6216757361027d7511&ls=fdf715747c670c7977157370&m=fefd1273716607&l=fecd177070660c7d&s=fe2f167176660674721171&jb=ffcf14&t=    So there it is. I know not everyone here is an Obama supporter, and diversity  of opinion is a strength, not a weakness of our community -- but you've ""had my  back"" in so many fights these last years, I knew I could ask you to consider  signing up for another mission.  I have to tell you, this campaign has me excited. Excited, because I have seen  so much hope out there as I've traveled the country for Barack. Excited,  because as frustrated as I've been that the three words ""George W. Bush""  silenced any conversation at dinner tables around the country the last  eight years, I think we've found three words that will open a conversation  across the old divides, regardless of race, religion, gender, or income level -- and those three words are ""President Barack Obama"".  So please, click here to contribute what you can for Barack's campaign: http://click.email.johnkerry.com/?ju=fe6216757361027d7511&ls=fdf715747c670c7977157370&m=fefd1273716607&l=fecd177070660c7d&s=fe2f167176660674721171&jb=ffcf14&t=   I care about making this happen. I care about seeing Barack Obama win against  John McCain in a way that will break the Republican Roadblock in the Senate and  grow our progressive majority in the Congress.  Please dig deep -- I know we can do this.   This feels like the moment that got me and my generation to care about  politics -- and I want it to be the moment that millions more start to care for  the first time, or to care again, the way that you and I do now.

A court is going to consider what the apparent intent was -- not try to stretch the meaning beyond the obvious.  > Would you expect an art *materials* catalogue to...  Hereafter, you are trying to stretch the meaning to something that it obviously wasn't intended to mean.  You can do that, because the license is POORLY WRITTEN. Which I have already said. Miraculously, you and I appear to AGREE on that point.  One consequence of this is that some lawyer might try to play the same games with the language that you are doing here.  I think the court would laugh in his face, but who knows?  > I'm trying to understand how it is possible to claim that compilers > don't fit the meaning of materials there  That would be by using the *normal*, *first* definition of ""materials"" and not some alternate meaning that has come about by association.  There is also the point that it wouldn't make any sense to require the meaning you are attempting to press: is there even a compiler which can be ""released in source format under conditions of this license""? If not, then it stands to reason that the author, knowing this, cannot have intended to limit compilation to such a hypothetical compiler. This is yet more evidence for an intent which agrees with the obvious interpretation of the language.  So, are you saying you honestly believe the author's intent was to block compilation of changes to his package altogether? If so, why distribute source at all? Furthermore, you believe that having this irrational intent, he then tried to hide it by using a word which *might* be interpreted to support his intent, but whose most obvious meaning contradicts it?  I find that a pretty implausible theory.  Your interpretation is distorts the license's original intent by using alternate meanings of words. As such it may even be semantically correct (that is, it may be within the set of possible semantic meanings of the utterance), but it is pragmatically incorrect (it is not the subset of that set that was meant by the author -- as we can tell from context). Intent is a matter of pragmatics[1] -- the study of situated utterances as evidence for meaning, not semantics[2] -- the study of isolated utterances for potential meaning.  You're pounding very hard on the semantics, trying to broaden the set of possible meanings, and you're not wrong about that as far as you go, but that's missing the point. The question was not ""what could this sentence possibly mean"", but ""what did this sentence mean when the author wrote it"" -- which is what actually matters legally.  The rest of the license, the fact of using the license, the fact of releasing software with source code and the consequences of licensing choices all provide situational information which supports the pragmatic interpretation of the sentence in question.  The fact that courts (or we) have to go beyond semantics to understand the license is a serious flaw of the license, which I've already pointed out, but as evidence of the author's actual intent, I think it is sufficient.

But we don't really know exactly why Cho Seung-Hui went on a rampage on the campus of Virginia Tech. For our first story, correspondent Scott Pelley talks to Secret Service intelligence officers, whose exhaustive research into the minds of potential assassins and school shooters will provide valuable insights. Pelley is speaking with the officers today, April 20, and will report this story over the weekend, for what will perhaps be the freshest look yet at the mind of this mass killer.         This past week was also the deadliest in Baghdad - over 200 Iraqis were killed in a single day.  It has become a living hell for citizens of Baghdad just trying to get through an average day, as correspondent Lara Logan reports in our second story. How does one live in such a place? Very carefully, reports Logan, and often with the protection of a weapon, or in the case of Dr. Quoresh al-Kasir, the U.S. military. Nearly 200 doctors have been murdered in Iraq by insurgents intent on destroying Iraqi society. Soon after bullets began to crash through his windows, Dr. Quoresh heard a hopeful sound. ""We heard the helicopters starting to come to the area. My sons and daughter said, 'Oh, Baba, the Americans started to reach the area.'""     Watch  Logan's Reporter's Notebook.        The firing of Don Imus for uttering racially charged and misogynistic words black rap stars routinely use in their lyrics has shifted the spotlight to hip-hop culture and its dark messages.  As you'll see in our third piece, CNN's Anderson Cooper discovers that one of the rappers' popular messages, ""stop snitchin',"" does not help the police, but has actually confounded investigators' efforts to solve crimes, especially murder, and has now created some lawless neighborhoods.  Says Geoffrey Canada, educator and anti-violence advocate from New York City's Harlem neighborhood, ""It's like we're saying to the criminals, 'You can have our community....Do anything you want and we will either deal with it ourselves or we'll simply ignore it.'""     Watch  Cooper's Reporter's Notebook.        These stories, and Andy Rooney's love affair with books, this Sunday, April 22, on 60 Minutes at 7 p.m. ET/PT.

legitimate,phishing,True,"[python-win32] wmi, Win32_ScheduledJob and Execution User I've followed Tim Golden's cookbook example to schedule a job via his Python wmi module; however, I need to specify the user account a scheduled job gets executed under (i.e., the process owner).  The cookbook example will schedule a job owned by SYSTEM.  I note the actual WMI library provides for a User and Password option, which do not appear to be visible options from within the python wmi module's Win32_ScheduledJob call.  I am uncertain if the aforementioned User and Password options actually cause the scheduled job to be run as that user?  As a workaround I schedule my job via the Win32_ScheduledJob call and follow this up with a Win32_Process.Create call to ""schtasks.exe"", in which I change the job id's run user (i.e., via the /RU option) to the appropriate user name.  Is there a way I can specify the run (or execution) user of a scheduled job within the Win32_ScheduledJob call or via the wmi interface?  The way I am doing it right now, I could have simply called schtasks.exe directly and had it create the process with the intended run user, which I don't find very eloquent.

The paper is available on the Publications page of my website, www.EHirst.com << File: http://www.ehirst.com/ >> . Please let me know if you have any comments on the paper. Here is a summary of the paper:         California was supposed to show the rest of the nation a brighter electricity future. That future, as outlined by the California Public Utilities Commission in 1994, envisioned an electricity industry featuring competitive markets. Such markets were intended to produce lower costs and more choices for consumers, while ensuring profits for efficient energy suppliers and encouraging the retirement of old, inefficient power plants.         Although the first two years of restructuring (beginning in April 1998) seemed to bear out these promises, the last year has been a disaster for California's electricity consumers, taxpayers, and electric utilities. Part of the fallout from California's electricity crisis is considerable concern-even opposition-in other states to restructuring the electricity industry.          Although a few states have decided, based on the California experience, not to restructure, I believe that is the wrong outcome. Instead, the primary lessons other states should learn from California are that competitive markets can work; competition is not to blame for California's problems; and basic economic principles of supply, demand, and prices affect market outcomes.         Section 2 of this paper briefly reviews the history of electricity regulation and restructuring in California and the problems that occurred beginning in May 2000. Section 3, the heart of this paper, offers guidance to other states on the key ingredients of a competitive electricity industry. This section makes several points:   Maintain a favorable investment and regulatory climate for new generation to ensure that enough generation capacity is online and planned to meet growing loads.   Ensure that enough infrastructure (transmission capacity and natural gas pipeline capacity) is in place and planned to meet growing loads, maintain reliability, connect new generators to the grid, support large regional markets, and provide fuel to power plants.   Encourage retail customers to participate in dynamic-pricing and voluntary-load-reduction programs (i.e., couple retail and wholesale markets).   Create honest retail competition: avoid standard-offer rates with artificial discounts and create conditions that encourage many companies to offer retail services without favoring individual competitors.   Encourage electricity suppliers to manage and diversify their supply and price risks.   Create efficient and integrated wholesale markets for energy, ancillary services, and transmission congestion.   Monitor and minimize horizontal market power (generation) and vertical market power (combined ownership and operation of generation and transmission).           Ultimately, competitive markets for electricity will lower costs and prices, better align consumer prices with producer costs, improve producer efficiency in both investment and operation, maintain or improve reliability, and yield greater innovation in customer services and pricing options.          But, this transition from one industry structure to another is turning out to be long and complicated. It is complicated because electricity is so important to our modern, high-tech society; electricity is our most flexible fuel, providing light, heat, motive power, and the energy to operate all our electronic equipment. Also, electricity truly is a real-time product for which production and consumption must occur at the same time.          Although the problems that have occurred in California are substantial and worrisome, regulators and legislators in other states should focus on the long-term benefits of competitive electricity markets and accept the possible short-term problems that may occur. They also need to recognize that wholesale markets are regional in scope and extend far beyond the boundaries of any single state. Finally, competition in retail and wholesale markets must be coordinated; in particular, it is not possible to have competitive wholesale markets unless at least some retail load faces time varying prices.          If states restructure properly to create competitive markets for wholesale energy and retail services, we should all benefit. Consumers will enjoy lower prices, they will have many more choices of energy services and price-risk tradeoffs, reliability will be improved because most reliability services will be obtained through markets instead of by engineering edict, and the financial risks associated with building and operating power plants will be assigned properly to investors rather than consumers.

Jon Frankel, who was a correspondent on our show, now can claim the coolest of titles: ""documentary filmmaker.""  He made a film called ""Hellfighters: a Season in Harlem,"" which will have its premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival.  The film is about the promise and struggles of a group of teenagers, brought together to play football in Harlem.  Jon's got a great eye and big heart, so I'm sure the movie is a treat to watch; I can't wait to see it.    Mark McEwen was the weatherman when I joined the show seven years ago, and he became a pal I could always count on to make me laugh, and, in turn, someone who'd laugh at my stupid jokes.      He moved to Orlando a while back, and in 2005, Mark suffered a terrible stroke. He was at the airport at the time and didn't recognize the symptoms so he kept right on traveling. The stroke ended up almost killing him. Luckily for all of us who love him, he survived, and is determined to make a full recovery. This morning he came on the show to talk about  recognizing the signs of a stroke. I cannot emphasize enough how important it is to know these signs because every moment is critical.    I know this because it happened to my mom as well -- not once, but twice. The first stroke, which happened when I was a baby, nearly killed her. The second, which struck when I was in high school, was just as severe, but thank goodness she knew the symptoms and was able to get to the hospital in time to save her life. With time, therapy, prayer and a lot of hard work, she's now fully recovered. I'm so proud of her, but it's an experience I wish no other family ever had to go through. So I'm grateful to Mark, for his openness and courage in talking about this. I'm also thankful because I had a few moments to hang out with him this morning. The last time we spoke, he had a tough time talking and I was a weepy mess. Today we were back to old form: telling stupid jokes and laughing.      Tomorrow on the Saturday Early Show, we'll have some important advice you'll want to remember the next time you use your debit card. We'll also preview some romantic summer movies, cook up a Mediterranean meal with our ""Chef on a Shoestring,"" and enjoy a live performance from rock/pop balladeer Jon McLaughlin in our Second Cup Cafe. Hope you'll join us.   ________________________________   Tracy  Smith EarlyShow@cbs.com     	 	 	Advertisement     ________________________________  ________________________________  To unsubscribe or change your subscription options, click here  .

Based on that I can make these guesses:   X-Spam-Score seems to be score *10, and truncated instead of rounded.  This accounts for how -6.6 can become -65.. (-6.58 will round to -6.6,  but multiply and truncate and you get -65)  X-Spam-Bar probably generates a series of - or + signs for each full  point of score in that direction. (similar to SA's _STARS(*)_ tag, but  with negative scores represented). It's a wild guess, but seems reasonable.",0

phishing,legitimate,True,"for assistant Dear Sir, I am Alhaji Mohammed Abacha, the son of the late Nigerian Head of State who died on the 8th of June 1998 while in active services. Following the sudden death of my father, General Sani Abacha, the present Civilian Government has thrown my family and I into a state of utter confusion,  frustration,and hopelessness.  I have been subjected to inhuman physical and physiological torture, incarceration by the security Agents in my country. I was only recently released from detention after been arraigned before the Federal High Court of Nigeria for an offence committed by my late father. The incumbent civilian administration of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo has intensified his probe into my late father's activities while in the office and he has frozen all our local and foreign accounts together with  other assets of my family as a retaliation for what my late father did to him when he was alive as the Head of the Military regime in Nigeria.  As a matter of fact, we have been declared bankrupt and they are not relenting to make us poor for life.As a man that is so traumatized, I have lost confidence with anybody within my country as all those who benefited immensely during the regime of my late father have openly abandoned all my family.   MY REASONS FOR CONTACTING YOU. I got your contacts through my personal research and out of desperation decided to reach you through this medium.   You must have heard over the media reports and the Internet on the recovery of various huge sums of money deposited by my late father in different Banks and security firms abroad.  Some of these banks and security firms willingly gave-up/divulge their banking secrets and disclosed to the present civilian administration of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, all my family's cash lodgement and monetary transactions with them.Please my dear, I repose great confidence in you and I hope you will not betray my confidence in you.   I have secretly deposited the sum of $20,000,000.00 with a security firm abroad whose name is withheld for now until we open communications. The money is contained in a metal box consignment with Security Deposit Number.I shall be grateful if you could receive this fund into your Bank account for safekeeping.  This arrangement is known to you and my junior brother (Abbas) only. So I will deal directly with you. I am proposing a 20% share of the fund to you for your kind assistance. I shall provide for you all the documents of the fund deposit with the security firm, and raise a power of attorney `to enable you claim and receive this fund into your bank account. Also this transaction demands absolute disclose it to anybody  irrespective of your relation with the person.  Remember, loose lips sinks ship I am looking forward to your urgent and positive response via my email =. abacha2@webmail.co.za.  Best regards Alhaji Mohammed Abacha.",1

All our transport destinations are under our control. We need our gateway to know if the user exists before hand to reduce filter load. We make sure all of our customers for who we transport to their own server make sure their server let us know when asked and, if possible, restrict any SMTP but from us. But do we still stand a chance of abuse issues? Do you think I still need to be selective to my known transports?  All is well since getting the correct reject code of 550 set, I guess I was getting hammered by my own request :-|  Thanks to all for the help :)  --  Robert",0

legitimate,phishing,True,"[Ip-health] USA for Innovation letter to Congress http://www.usaforinnovation.org/news/050907_USAFI_Adelman%20Letter.pdf  Ambassador Kenneth L. Adelman, Executive Director USA For Innovation P.O. Box 57052 Washington, DC 20037-7052  May 9, 2007  Members of Congress United States of America  Dear Member of Congress:  I wish to bring to your immediate attention the recent attacks on American intellectual property being perpetrated by Brazil and Thailand. These attacks endanger the basis of American prosperity, innovation, and jobs. Unless vigorous measures are taken soon, such attacks are likely to spread to other countries, to the further detriment of U.S. national interests.  Last Friday, Brazils President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva issued a ""compulsory license"" to override the U.S. patent on an AIDS drug made by Merck. Obviously, this measure undercuts future research and development on medical innovation, upon which the health of millions around the world depend.  The public rationale given by the governments of Thailand and Brazil to override the property rights of foreign firms is invalid. Issuing a compulsory license in this manner is considered by USA for Innovation to be illegitimate under World Trade Organization rules, indisputably bad policy, and dangerous precedent.  When Brazil and Thailand issue compulsory licenses, they signal to the world their unwillingness to respect international patent protection. If this grows into more of a trend  which it will, unless strongly resisted -- innovators will no longer choose to provide life-saving drugs and other medicines in these countries.  Moreover, such a move is short-sighted for the countries themselves. It hurts local firms in Brazil and Thailand trying to attract foreign investment. It hurts their patients, who will no longer have access to patented medicines which, in many cases, are the only treatments proven safe and effective.  Thailand and Brazil have no excuse for their behavior. They are not poor countries, and cannot claim to be in crisis. Thailands GDP ranks it among the top 10% wealthiest countries in the world, and its government spends little on health care. The World Health Organization notes that Thailand spends far less on health care (3.3% of GDP) than peers such as Argentina (8.9%) or poorer countries like Cambodia (10.9%) or Lebanon (10.2%). The United States spends 15.2%.  What is true in Thailand is even truer of Brazil. It is not only in the top 10% of richest countries in the world, but in the top 5%. While Brazil spends a greater percentage of its GDP on health (7.6%) than Thailand, it is still half of what America spends.  In attacking intellectual property rights of American and European companies, Brazil and Thailand threaten innovation, which is the lifeblood of our economy. In this age of globalization, U.S. intellectual property is our comparative advantage.  A 2005 study by two leading economists  the Democratic, Clinton-appointee Dr. Robert Shapiro and Republican advisor Dr. Kevin Hassett -- estimates that U.S. intellectual property is worth between $5 trillion and $5.5 trillion. This equals approximately 45% of the U.S. GDP, and is greater than the GDP of any other nation in the world.  Intellectual property accounts for about one-quarter of all business investment over the last decade. Intangibles now account for nearly two-thirds of the market value of large U.S. public companies.  As importantly, nearly 3 million American jobs depend on continued investment in biopharmaceuticals. The world benefits from the life-saving results produced by these American scientists, researchers, doctors and teachers. More than 70% of all world medicines are created by Americans. International refusal to pay for these products not only threatens millions of American jobs, it endangers our ability to produce the new medical treatments the ailing around the world need most desperately.  Both Brazil and Thailand enjoy extraordinary benefits from Americans. While American workers face expensive tariffs when exporting goods and services to these countries (including, incredibly, taxes and tariffs on medical products), both Brazil and Thailand receive generous treatment when sending their products to the U.S. under the Generalized System of Preferences.  Both countries also receive a host of military, humanitarian and other forms of assistance from the U.S. government, in addition to private donations from millions of American charities. It seems appropriate to remind leaders of these countries that the United States will protect innovation-producing American firms and jobs. Doing so now, in a vigorous manner, will save lives in these countries and throughout the world.  Sincerely yours,  Kenneth L.

I would appreciate comments from anyone, pro or > con, with knowledge and experience of these things, however, as I'm rather > limited on both.  I agree - it's never a good idea to use the same data for creating your classifier and determining it's effectiveness (I meant to say ""pick the one with the lowest error rate on your TEST data"").  The reason to choose from many random starts is that fitting a given neural network _model_ (ie. input x, n nodes, ...) is very hard due to the large overparameterisation of the problem space.  For example, the parameters for one node in a given layer can be exchanged with the parameters of another node (as well as the parameters that use those nodes in next layer), without changing the overall model.  This makes it very hard to optimise, and nnet in R often gets stuck in local minima. Looking at what individual nodes are doing, you often see examples where some nodes contribute nothing to the overall classification. The random starts aren't to find different models but to find the parameters for the given model that fits best.  And following this line of argument, you would probably want to use the internal criterion value, rather than some external measure of accuracy.  > The simple answer to the question of obtaining the error rate using > validation data is: Do whatever you like to choose/fit a classifier on the > training set. **Once you are done,** the estimate of your error rate is the > error rate you get on applying that classifier to the validation set.

You need yet new validation data for that.  Understanding that that estimate is biased is important, but in practice, do people really care that much?  If you have looked at a single plot of your data and used that to inform your choice of the classifier your estimates will already be biased (but if you have used other knowledge of the data or subject area, you might expect them to be biased in a positive direction).

You have to make sure your locale is set to ja_JP.UTF-8  and you need to  make sure that kinput2 is working properly. This will involve having  kinput2 and cannaserver both running.  Here is more information:  http://dspnet.fr/~lonewolf/LinuxJapan/Howto_English_Japanese.html  Make sure that the XMODIFIERS environment variable is set such as this  XMODIFIERS=""@im=kinput2""  Then you can test input first using notepad.  run ~/cxoffice/bin/wine  notepad then try inputing Japanese into notepad.

legitimate,phishing,True,"ping... ping... ping... Some survey-type questions for non-Bell p9 sites...  Out there, who is actually gotten p9 running? (that is, you've got a distribution and you've installed it and gotten a usable system up and running)  Of those, how many still have their Plan 9 partition/machine?  Of those, how many log onto it regularly, or use it as their  system of choice?  How about configurations - who is using what? SPARCS? x86's? Dedicated file servers? WORM drives?  If a Plan 9 archive site opened, would you want to use 9P to talk to it, or FTP? What would you want to upload? What would you want to see there?  How many people at your site use Plan 9? How many develop or do research on it? What are they doing?  Of particular interest would be development work - I think we should have a better idea of what the rest of the world is doing, to avoid messy duplication.  Post your answers or mail them to me, and I'll strip out locations/identities if you don't want to publish to the world that you're running a system that 1) has a user `none' that can be accessed from anywhere, and 2) can listen to a Ethernet promiscuously Oops - that just slipped out. I'm not trying to give bozos ideas (you can't telnet in as none from outside our department anyway) but some better way of controlling access to the `none' account better be dreamed up (not everyone has the luxury of a firewalled system). Grumph.  Another random question while I'm on - are there any good, high-speed point-to-point interfaces to hook up PC's at a fairly short distance (say 0.5m)? It strikes me that most networks are overkill for linking a file server and cpu server, given that they are designed for many hosts and fairly large distances. Neither of these factors apply to a cpu/fs link. A cheap solution to the above would be appreciated.  Geoff.",0

legitimate,phishing,True,"Hi everybody!I'm writing a web application in java (tomcat + jsp/servlets + database  access with postgreSQL).This will be released under the GPL and will eventually be useful as a  framework for other web applications.The application main focus is e-commerce, but not limited to that.I would like to use some form of cryptography to protect data on the  database, but I have some problem figuring out the right approach.Above all, how to store passwords and keys in a shared web server.A problem that I was unable to solve is how to store keys for  encryption/decryption. The api that I'm using is the jca (jdk1.4.x),  and the methods of saving generated keys in keystores fails always. I can serialize the object, and store in the database, but this is not  the most secure approach: this key is needed to decrypt data in the  database, but the database is accessible from the web application.  Assuming that I can find a good and secure place where to store the  database password, I can use a different database with different  user... Argh... to complex and doesn't really solve the problem.Where I can found good documentation about this topic?There is another approach that I would share with the list, something I  thought that can be of bit interest, but probabily wrong and insecure.  After all, I'm a real beginner in secure programming, and I'm here to  learn methods and technics.First of all, I need a secure way to keep database passwords secure, so  I have to keep them separate from the main server. The right approach  could be using a small java bean application that run as normal user  (not tomcat, so it is not shared with other web services or, worst, the  nobody user), that has no shell login, but has a default home directory  or a place where it can hold passwords and keys.The web application could then open an ssl connection (could be done in  the init method at server startup) to get database passwords. The small  bean could check via code signature/rmi/whatever else that the source  is the right one, and handle all the database connections, or give the  db connection/password to the main web application.In this way, we solve the problem of keeping the keys and passwords in  shared directories, and also, an attacker should get root/bean user  account to read data. This is not perfect, and works only if your  provider gives the opportunity to configure a separated java  application (that means, really, another server running in the  background).Any suggestions?Thank you, Mario Torre --  Please avoid sending me Word or PowerPoint attachments.

After his dealt, the democratic government that followed his regime constificated all his local and foreign bank accounts but this one with my Commision was left untouched due to the fast that the deposit was made in a ficticious name and nobody had the knowledge that it was deposited by the late dictator except my very self. Since his death, I have managed the account with keen interest with the hope of transfering the fund abroad before my retirement from service.

phishing,legitimate,True,"We can do this  Dear Sir,      I am DR KABO HAMMED     I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, an American oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) deposited for twelve calendar months, valued at US$41,500,000.00 (Forty-one Million, five hundred Thousand Dollars) in my branch upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract  employers, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident  with his family along Benin/Shagamu Express Way. On  further investigation, I found out that he did not  leave a WILL and allattempts to trace his next of kin  were fruitless.      I therefore made further investigation and discovered  that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any next of kin n all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork. This sum of US$41,500,000.00 is still sitting in the Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will come forward to claim it.  According to the Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.      Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Barry Kelly so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide me immediately with your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents  and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin.   We shall employ the services of two attorneys for drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world, which you provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you.      There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via email. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you Understand. please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.

phishing,legitimate,True,"From: Mr.Al-Zarqawi Yusuf  From: Mr.Al-Zarqawi Yusuf  Dear Friend,  Your first reaction to this mail will be total rejection, scare and maybe disbelief, owning largely to the atrocities people commit these days.But this mail comes from a devastated, sorrowful and emotional laden soul that needs compassion from a kind and good spirited person to wipe away my tears and appropriate my dream and humanitarian gesture.  As you read this, I don't want you to  feel sorry for me, because, I believe everyone dies someday.,I am Al-Zarqawi Yusuf, A Oil merchant in Dubai, United Arab Emirate ( UAE). I have been diagnosed with Cancer, which was discovered very late, due to my laxity in caring for my health. It has defiled all forms of medicine; Right now I have only about a limited to live, according to my Medical Doctor. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for myself but the Oil business.Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.  I believe when Allah  gives me a second chance and  heal me I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it.I have sowed a seed for my healing I have willed and given most of my properties and assets to my immediate and extended family members and as well as a few close friends. i want Allah to be merciful to me and accept my soul and so, I have decided to give arms to charity organizations and give succor and comfort to the less privileged of the Tsunami and Hurricane Katrina Victims, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth so far, by distributed some of this money to some charity organizations in India,Hurricane Katrina victims in USA and other part of the world. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self anymore.I once asked members of my family  to close one of my accounts in Saudi Bank and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization and to the less  privileged in Bulgaria and Sudan.  They cashed the money but kept it only to themselves.  Hence I do not trust them anymore,as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them already.The last of my money, which no one knows of, is the huge cash deposit of Thirty Five Million United States Dollars ( US$35Million)  that I have in the Vault of The Security Company as family valuable since the year 2003 for safekeeping.I want you to collect this deposit on my behalf and disburse it to the Tsunami Earthquake victims in Asia for the less privileged. Please send me a mail to indicate your wiliness to assist in this disbursement.

legitimate,phishing,True,"Cabot Wealth Advisiory 7/5/07 - TV, Intelligence and More July 5, 2007  Salem, Massachusetts  By Timothy Lutts  -----  There's Nothing On!  The SAT Measures What?  A Company With Predictive Decisioning Software  -----  My wife recently attended a conference in upstate New York and one night found herself back in her hotel room, turning to the television for entertainment.  Now, in our family, real-time network television is a rare event.    Thanks to Replay TV, a one-time competitor of TiVo in the DVR (digital video recorder) business, our favorite shows get recorded on a big hard disk and we watch them when we want, skipping the commercials as we go.  In fact, the only time we watch commercials is during the Super Bowl.  More often, we read.  In any event, there was my wife, in a New York state hotel room, ""forced"" to choose from a dreadful selection of real-time network TV offerings.  Of course she could have turned it off, but in that dull hotel room in that strange town, she was just searching for a little life, a little humor, a little intelligence.  What she got was bad TV, along with an onslaught of repetitive, often-insulting commercials.  So she called me, and somewhere along the way she asked, ""Why do people watch this garbage?  And why do the networks play the same commercials, sometimes several times during the same show?""  I couldn't give her an easy answer, but I did sympathize, and that's really what she wanted.  Soon after, I googled ""top ten TV shows,"" and here's what I found.  America's Got Talent Dateline NBC Deal or No Deal Law and Order N-C-I-S C-S-I Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader? Two and A Half Men So You Think You Can Dance? C-S-I Miami  I've never seen any of these, which goes to show you how out of touch I am.  But I do know (from reading) that four of them are crime dramas, two are talent searches, two are game shows, one is a sitcom and one is a news magazine that typically focuses on human-interest stories.  Reviewing this list, I'm reminded of the words of HL Mencken, who wrote, ""No one in this world, so far as I know, has ever lost money by underestimating the intelligence of the great masses of the plain people.""  Then, a few days ago one of my editors commented to me, no doubt after viewing one of the those headlines like ""Man Shoots Self in Groin While Attempting To Make Ham Sandwich,"" ""You know, half of Americans are of below average intelligence.""  Upon reflection, it's obvious.  And it's statistically inevitable.    The average is near the middle, so half will always be below the average (technically, below the median, but given the very large numbers we're dealing with, there's little difference.)  And if you don't know the difference between mean and median, you probably haven't crammed for an SAT test lately.  The converse, however, does not mean that if you do know the difference you have crammed for the test recently.  That's logic at work.  And the SAT, now that I've brought it up, is not what it used to be.  In 1901 it debuted as the Scholastic Achievement Test, supposedly measuring what students had learned.  In 1941, the name was changed to Scholastic Aptitude Test, supposedly measuring what students were capable of learning, if they had the proper socio-economic advantages.  In 1990, that was changed to Scholastic Assessment Test, supposedly measuring . . . something scholastic?  And in 1994 the name was changed to SAT (the letters officially standing for nothing at all!)  Finally (or, should I say, most recently, because I suspect there are more changes around the corner), in 2005 the name was changed to SAT Reasoning Test, creating a potential redundancy of the word ""Test"" but only if the first T still stood for Test, which it doesn't.  Reasoning, of course, includes logic, and I like that a lot. I hope they keep that name for a while.  Now, I took the SAT a few decades back.  Two of my kids have taken it and the third is likely to in a couple years.  But something else has changed over the decades besides the name.  In 1995 the yardstick for scoring was adjusted to account for the growing number of kids from less rigorous schools taking the test.  The reason?  The big bulge in the middle of the distribution curve, which had previously been centered at 400, had slipped down into the mid-300s.  To get the mid-point back up, the average verbal score was artificially increased by some 70 points while the average math score had 20-30 points added.  The kids at the top and bottom were barely affected, but the masses of average kids near the middle saw their scores bumped up dramatically.  What does it matter?  Well, a good score helps you get into college.    But is there a correlation between success on the SAT and success in college?  Looking further out, is there correlation between success on the SAT and success in life?  The simple answer is, some, but not a lot.  And more and more colleges are recognizing that; the number of colleges that admit students without regard to test scores now exceeds 400.  But the SAT lives on, and will continue to be here for years to come.  Why?  In part because it's the product of The College Board.    The College Board is a non-profit organization, and while there's no doubt that it works hard to serve the high schools and colleges and families that use it, there's even less doubt - in my mind - that the organization works even harder to ensure its own survival.   ----- ADVERTISEMENT -----  Join Cabot Stock of The Month and get in on the next stock that explodes like these...   * Broadvision-up 670%  * Intuitive Surgical-up 500%  * Yahoo-up 317%  * Amazon.com-up 1,290%  * First Marblehead-up 50%  * International Game Technology-up 110%  * eResearch Technology-up 180%  * NetEase-up 100%  * Expedia-up 114%  * Broadcom-up 97%  * Netflix-up 173%  * Psychiatric Solutions-up 85%  * PetroKazakhstan-up 86%  * Nautilus-up 109%  That's the beauty of Cabot Stock of the Month.

""A financial services firm in Japan has begun offering lower mortgage interest rates to ""intelligent"" customers.  GE Consumer Finance Company is giving discounts to people who have good English or computer skills, and work in ""high-value"" areas such as the law.  The company says more highly skilled workers usually find it easier than others to get jobs and to keep them. They are therefore less likely to become insolvent and default on their home loan.  GE Consumer Finance Company claims this is the first time that mortgage rates have been calculated like this in Japan.  People who have high scores on a test of English proficiency and officially certified IT skills can apply for a small discount.  Those of them who also have certain jobs - such as lawyers, accountants, doctors and financial experts - can obtain further discounts.  If a couple are both employed in the 20 ""high-value"" professions listed by the company, they will be entitled to a major rate reduction.""  It makes sense, and I'm guessing it's illegal to discriminate that way in the U.S.  -----  Getting back to TV, the problem is not just the quality of programming but the quantity of time people spend viewing.  The TV is on for over 7 hours in the average American home, and the average American watches over 4 hours of TV per day.  Worse still, the average American child watches 1,023 hours of TV a year and spends 900 hours in school.  And one thing they're seeing in those hours is commercials.  For broadcast TV, commercials pay the bills, and the advertisers are doing all they can to ensure that the message from those commercials reaches your brain.  But more and more these days, people are working to avoid those commercials by fast-forwarding through them using DVRs.  So NBC recently tested people to see if those commercials had any impact at high-speed.  NBC, you know, wants its advertisers' money even if viewers are watching at fast speeds.  The result, according to a story three days ago in The New York Times, ""judging from the biological reactions, the test subjects were just as engaged while watching fast-forwarded advertisements as they were while viewing opening scenes from the NBC show ""Heroes"" at regular speed.""  When it comes to fast-forward advertisements, ""the assumption has always been that they have no economic value, that they have no communication value,"" said Alan Wurtzel, president for research at NBC Universal. ""But the fact of the matter is we're learning that they are valuable.""  And they're so ""valuable"" to the financial health of the TV industry that the commercial-skipping DVR that I bought years ago can no longer be bought!  But the problem is not just the commercials.  The problem is that every minute spent watching TV is a minute not being used to reflect, to do something productive, or to interact with other family members.  And the result of all this TV viewing, according to a recent study by the Culture and Media Institute, is that ""increased exposure to television correlates with a decline in acceptance of personal responsibility.""  Now, it's important to note that the word correlate was used there.    Officially, there's no established causality.  But my sense is that our country has seen a marked decrease in a sense of personal responsibility; that too many people all too easily blame others for their troubles.  And when personal responsibility shrinks, we get a culture that thinks it's okay to act stupid because somebody else will pick up the tab.  ----- Contest -----  Now, there is an investment idea coming here, but first I want to give a reward to a loyal reader who has chosen to read this far.

Do it now.  -----  And now, finally, here we are at today's stock.  It's about intelligence and it's about marketing, and if you understand how important marketing is to the world, you may like this one enough to invest in it.  You know and I know that at every turn, companies are doing their darndest to sell us things.  At Amazon they know what I've bought before and thus know what to sell me next.  And at Netflix they know what movies I've rated highly so they can suggest other movies they think I'd enjoy.  Those two firms have developed specialized software that serves their individual needs, but for most companies, there's off-the-shelf software that works very well, and a lot of it is coming from a company named Chordiant.  Here's what we wrote in a recent issue of Cabot Top Ten Report.  ""Chordiant (CHRD) makes customer service and marketing software that helps big companies deal with their customers, so that the goals of both the merchant and the customer are met. Customers include 21st Century Insurance, Bank of Ireland, Banque Populaire, Barclays, Capital One, Covad Communications, Cox Communications, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Lloyds, MetLife, Nokia, Prudential, Royal Bank of Scotland, Royal Dutch Shell, Time Warner Cable, T-Mobile, UPS and Wachovia. These are huge blue-chip companies, yet Chordiant is still a small company, and growing fast. Historically, the company has had trouble making a profit (its last profitable year was 2004), but after the first quarter's terrific results, CEO Steven R. Springsteel commented that solid profitability was ""due to the strong performance in our international business, the acceleration of percentage of completion project implementations in Europe, and greater enablement of our partners resulting in fewer Chordiant resources being required on some project implementations."" It sounds good to us. Since then the company has been awarded a patent for ""advanced predictive decisioning technology."" In other words, the companies using this software sometimes know what you're going to buy before you do! As companies come to depend on this software, Chordiant's future is likely to be consistently profitable, and the realization of that is why the stock is strong today.""  Digging deeper, I see that Chordiant has been growing revenues since 2003, and in the latest quarter saw revenues grow 25% from the year before to $32.8 million, while earnings jumped from a penny per share to $0.18 per share.  Analysts are projecting a profit of $0.48 per share this year and $0.72 per share next year.  And the after-tax profit margin was a fat 19.6%.  Trading at 16, it's rather low-priced and thus carries the extra risk of volatility that comes from stocks at this level.   But average trading volume is nearly 500,000 shares per day, and institutional interest is growing.  I'd like it better on a dip to 15, but if it doesn't dip there in the week ahead, 16 may be the best price you'll get.  -----  Editor's note:  To get regular updates on Chordiant, and to get first notice of other hot stocks, consider a no-risk trial subscription to Cabot Top Ten Report.

legitimate,phishing,True,"re : transitional assignments all i have received a few notes about this since this one but i will try to respond to all questions here . please see below responses in red : enron capital sally - husband and 3 children - ages 15 , 11 and 2 ) . i understand that the houses which have been vacated due to returning expats have all been filled , so can you have someone arrange for corporate housing that will accommodate them ? i think the best way to go here is for us to use serviced apartments as it will be very difficult to find a lease for such a short period for this type of accommodation . my assistant , lisa , has put a call in to a service who can help us find serviced accommodation in south kensington / chelsea area or in dolphin square where we have people now who are very satisfied . is there a reason you are partial to south kensington / chelsea ? what if we find accommodation in another nice area of london within a short commute to the office ? when i have some options , i will let you know , probably on monday . immigration - due to the fact that they will be traveling back and forth and have made trips already , i feel it would be best to apply for work permits versus using the visa waiver . i have sent them the forms and requested that brent complete his and file immediately to increase chances of getting his sometime shortly after he arrives in the uk . i have informed him that he should arrive without his family if the permit has not been received by april 1 . brent ' s work permit will be submitted today and we may receive if before april lst , but it is unlikely . the way it works for this is as follows : brent will receive the work permit from us and if he is here , he will have to leave the uk and enter with the work permit for it to be validated . if his family are in houston , they will need to receive entry clearance in the us prior to arriving in the uk . this takes approx 7 working days and they will require either brent ' s original passport and work permit or a certified copy of each along with other things such as marriage and birth certificates . if brent decides to bring his family with him to london prior to receiving the work permit , they must say they are coming on a vacation for a short period of time and have a return ticket to back it up . once the permit is received , the family can either travel back to houston and submit the entry clearance visas there or they can all travel to amsterdam where they are currenlty issuing entry clearance without a problem . there is always a small element of risk in going to amsterdam , however , as do not have to issue the stamps there , they just do it because they are nice ! work permits are arriving approx 4 weeks from date of submission . we can discuss all of this on the 20 th . tax - please confirm whether paye will need to be paid for them during the short term assignment and then reclaimed through a treaty benefit . paye is due after 60 days ; however , if brent and sally are really only going to be here for approx 75 days , i am not going to inform the revenue that they are here . if this extends beyond the set time , we can look at options but the only responsiblility that brent and sally will have is to ensure they complete the tax organiser in order for us to get the tax back . also , as we would have to apply the treaty here , we need to ensure the salary costs stay in houston . jane , have you discussed this point ? benefits - i have suggested that they remain on us domestic payroll and benefits and , if medical claims arise that exceed what they would have spent in the us , they may claim the excess on the expense report . agreed . per diem - we need to discuss the appropriate amount based on family size . jane , please call me to discuss . i have left you a message , thanks let me know of any other issues we need to address . as always , i appreciate your help . jane",0
legitimate,phishing,True,"Twitter Updates, Statistics, and News Hello Twitter-ers,  We haven't sent out a monthly email update since November of last  year and a lot has happened since then. We've added new features,  upgraded performance, and lots of people are discovering Twitter  every day. Come on by and see if you recognize any friendly faces!  Visit: https://twitter.com/invitations  New Hires  We're excited to announce four new full-time employees since our  last update. Please welcome Lee and Robey to the Engineering team,  Ben to the Product team, and Aaron as our trusty office manager.  That's 16 full time Twitter employees! We're finally starting to  fill up our little building in San Francisco.  Interesting Statistics  Recently, we've been digging around a bit and discovering some  interesting statistics about Twitter usage. Some stats are fun-- like the number of mentions per US presidential candidate, or the  annotated spikes during the Super Bowl. Other stats are more  relative to usage. For example, people who have 10 followers and  are following about 10 people represent 50% of all Twitter-ers. If  you have more than 80 followers and you're following more than 70  people, then you are in the Twitter minority at about 10%.  More stats: http://tinyurl.com/3crjdt  Speaking of the candidates, we expect a flurry of Twitter updates  during tonight's debate between Clinton and Obama -- both of whom  have Twitter accounts. Do you follow them?  Hillary Clinton: http://twitter.com/hillaryclinton Barack Obama: http://twitter.com/barackobama  Twitter Partners  We work with some great companies around the world to make Twitter  happen. Much of our mobile texting and SMS traffic is handled in  cooperation with the talented folks at Ericsson. We've partnered  with Digital Garage to help us create the official Twitter Japan  service. (That's another interesting stat: 60% of our web traffic  is outside the US and 39% of that is from Japan.) And we have  chosen NTT America Enterprise Hosting to keep Twitter running  strong because of their global reach and history of reliability.  New Reply Feature  We noticed lots of folks sending @replies to each other so we've  added an easy way to reply to another person on Twitter. Just  click the little swoosh icon after an update in your timeline.  This will automatically insert the correct ""@username"" text in front of your next update.  Shortcode for India  If you have friends or family in India, please tell them that they  can access Twitter via SMS using our new shortcode: 5566511. Now  folks in India can send one text message to our new local number  and Twitter will route that message to all their friends and  family at no charge.  Twitter at the MoMA  Twittervision, a popular Twitter API project, is included in a  show at the New York Museum of Modern Art titled ""Design and the  Elastic Mind."" The show explores the relationship between science  and design and is open from February 24 to May 12, 2008.  Starling Goes Open Source  Twitter developed a distributed queue server to route vast numbers  of messages and we named it Starling. Last month, Starling was  released as open source. In addition to giving back to the open  source community, Starling improves as the open source community  makes enhancements and upgrades.  Twitter Wins first Ever 'Crunchie'  The first annual awards show sponsored by TechCrunch was held at  the Herbst Theater in San Francisco last month and the very first  award given out that night was to Twitter for ""Best Mobile  Startup.""

Cole's on Waugh To add to the next Newsletter:  Julie,  My partner and I have not been very visable at any of the local meetings,   however we ALWAYS anxiously await the next installment of the newsletter.  We  have been extremely busy making the house we bought  on Bomar liveable,  it  was barely that way when we bought it.  We wanted to add to your restaurant review.  Cole's on Waugh is a fairly decent restaurant with an OK menu.   The Garlic  soup was a definite hit,  and the atmosphere was great.  The wine list is  good and the prices were very reasonable. The entrees need a bit of work,  the beef was very ""Gamey"", the chicken  dishes were dry,  and the fried shrimp were a bit greasy.     All things aside we have eaten there three times,  and deem it worth while.   We have seen the menu and service improve with each visit.  Our hope is that  if enough people visit Cole's the menu will improve.  It is in a very  convenient location and the owners and staff are very friendly.

However, weak market fundamentals, including a sluggish economy and increased  US and Canadian supplies, will mitigate the usual winter price rise. CERA  expects an average Henry Hub price of $2.35 in November.  *  Although inventories are close to record levels, storage pressures are  increasingly unlikely to drive cash markets down significantly this year.   *  Gas demand will average 14 percent lower than a year earlier; residential  and commercial sectors show a decline with a return to normal weather, while a  weak economy offsets the return of ammonia and dual-fuel loads in the  industrial sector.  *  Regional storage inventories and weak regional demand should keep upward  pressure off of regional differentials.

The sale is for September, 2001 production.  We will need a deal put in Sitara for that sale along with the appropriate pathing from storage by logistics.  However, there is only 1,195,754 MMBTU on report 006 in Unify (for contracts 96018371, 96014189, and 96019236).  How do we account for this volumetic difference?  Connie will be truing up the GL to match the current Unify volume.  The GL was short approx. 18,000 MMBTU because a beginning balance was not booked.    This needs to happen before the upcoming close.  Thanks for you help in this matter.  Please let me know of any concerns.",0

legitimate,phishing,True,"RE: Transok Offsystem Fuel Accounting Procedure 	I have reviewed to orders issued by FERC.  They state ""Pipelines acquiring upstream capacity without prior Commission approval will be ""at-risk"" for the cost of that capacity"".  This means that Northern will need to track both the costs and revenues associated with offsystem transactions.  We believe that in tracking the revenues we can track by contract.    	Therefore, I believe in the meeting that if we needed to track these transactions Sue's group would maintain a manual spreadsheet for all off-system transactions.  	We also said Dan Fancler would need to review and determine how we would track the revenues thru the accounting side.    	I believe we have provided the answers we committed to in the meeting yesterday for today.  I plan to meet with Lynn B. tomorrow to discuss nominations, contract approval processes and other stuff.....  I'll let you know where we are as things develop.  thanks MW   -----Original Message----- From: 	Fancler, Dan   Sent:	Thursday, October 11, 2001 2:38 PM To:	Winckowski, Michele; Kirk, Steve; Miller, Kent; Neville, Sue; Williams, Jo; Blair, Lynn Cc:	Cobb Jr., John; Chandler, Bob; Kissner, Tim; Brennan, Patrick Subject:	Transok Offsystem Fuel Accounting Procedure  Based on our meeting 10/9/2001, I would like to propose the following accounting procedures for expensing in-kind fuel.  Case A:  In October 500,000 dts moves offsystem with only 486,000 dts expected to be returned to NNG in January.  NNG moves 500,000 dts from physical inventory to Offsystem inventory. No accounting entry made to the G/L.  Gas Accounting would reduce Offsystem inventory 14,000 dts to reflect in-kind fuel reduction in the same month the next NNG gas purchase transaction occurs (FIFO inventory method).  Reducing the Offsystem storage will cause UAF to increase, however purchasing gas for Operational Storage and not recording it to Operational Storage will offset the UAF increase.  If the next gas purchase transaction occurs in December at $3.00 then we would reduce Offsystem Storage Inventory by 14,000 dts in December production.  December UAF would not be affected.  Recorded in December: Debit 858 3rd Party Transport exp		14,000 * $3.00 = $42,000 	Credit A/P							($42,000)  Procedural Note:  All Third Party Offsystem storage statements must be forwarded to Gas Accounting (Dan Fancler) in order to reconcile the Physical to the Books.  Reconciling items such as in-kind fuel reductions will be reported to Storage Marketing noting that purchases for in-kind fuel replacements are needed.  If NNG purchases 100,000 dt for Operational Storage in December, then 14,000 dts would be carved out as in-kind fuel replacement and recorded to 858 (3rd party transport), the remaining 86,000 dts would be recorded as Operational Storage purchase and encroachment.  We may wish for the vender to issue two invoices.   Case B	 In October 500,000 dts moves offsystem, NNG purchases the in-kind replacement on Transok's system and 500,000  dts is expected to be returned to NNG in January.  NNG moves 500,000 dts from physical inventory to Offsystem inventory. No accounting entry made to the G/L. NNG does not reduce the offsystem physical inventory.  Recorded in month of purchase on Transok's system: Debit 858 3rd Party Transport exp		14,000 * $3.00 = $42,000 	Credit A/P							($42,000)  In both cases all transactions are recorded outside of operational storage, but gives Marketing some flexibility on when the in-kind replacement takes place but still follows a logical methodology (FIFO replacement).",0

legitimate,phishing,True,"Victory!  Progressives defeat a right-wing Dem in Congress Dear MoveOn member,  We've been working together for years to make sure Democrats hold to progressive values and stand up to President Bush. It hasn't always been easy. But yesterday, something amazing happened.  In what the Washington Post called a ""stunning victory,""1 progressive underdog Donna Edwards triumphed in her primary against right-wing Democrat Al Wynn. That's one more vote for ending the war, for affordable health care, for ending global warming. And thousands of MoveOn members pitched in time, money, and shoe leather to make it possible.  It's a big deal, because it's not just about this race--it's about reminding the rest of the Democrats in Congress that at the end of the day, the voters call the shots.  We need to build on this success--to keep putting pressure on Democrats who have lost sight of progressive values, even as we gear up to win the White House in the fall.  Our plan is to use grassroots tactics, advertising, and yes, more primary elections. We'll do it hand-in-hand with our partners at the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and Working for Us PAC.  Can you donate $100 to support a major campaign to hold Democrats accountable? Click here:  https://pol.moveon.org/donate/democratsaccountable.html?id=12121-4776693-O.m6e2&t=260  In 2006, we helped Democrats take back Congress from the Republicans. And while many Democrats have stood up against the war and corporate interests, some have folded.  Holding those people accountable is what we're about. In some cases, sending a clear message to Democrats may be as simple as flooding their offices with calls, or running ads in their district on a key issue. In other cases, getting involved in primary elections is one of the best ways to hold them accountable. In those cases, we'll look for more strong progressive challengers like Donna Edwards, and if there is no challenger in the district, we might help recruit one.  MoveOn members joined with union members and other progressives--including, ACORN, Democracy for America, EMILY's List, the League of Conservation Voters, Progressive Maryland, SEIU, Sierra Cub, United Food and Commercial Workers, Women's Voices, Women's Votes, and more--to help put it over the top for Donna Edwards.  Together we ran ads to educate voters, contributed thousands to Donna's campaign, and hit the streets to turn out voters.  A few months back, we surveyed MoveOn members about Democratic accountability and over 78% said this should be a major priority for the year. Donna Edwards' victory is proof that Democrats in Congress who vote like Republicans can be defeated.  Working with SEIU and Working for Us PAC, MoveOn members can help fight for a majority that's not just Democratic, but progressive.  Can you chip in $100 to support our campaign to make it happen now?  https://pol.moveon.org/donate/democratsaccountable.html?id=12121-4776693-O.m6e2&t=261  Thank you.  --Adam, Eli, Daniel, Joan, and the MoveOn.org Political Action Team   Wednesday, February 13th, 2008  1.

This is not so much ""clear"" as ""completely different"", but yes, that is the principle meaning of the word ""materials"" and the ony logical reason why the author would've used the term here.  A court is going to consider what the apparent intent was -- not try to stretch the meaning beyond the obvious.  > Would you expect an art *materials* catalogue to...  Hereafter, you are trying to stretch the meaning to something that it obviously wasn't intended to mean.  You can do that, because the license is POORLY WRITTEN. Which I have already said. Miraculously, you and I appear to AGREE on that point.  One consequence of this is that some lawyer might try to play the same games with the language that you are doing here.  I think the court would laugh in his face, but who knows?  > I'm trying to understand how it is possible to claim that compilers > don't fit the meaning of materials there  That would be by using the *normal*, *first* definition of ""materials"" and not some alternate meaning that has come about by association.  There is also the point that it wouldn't make any sense to require the meaning you are attempting to press: is there even a compiler which can be ""released in source format under conditions of this license""? If not, then it stands to reason that the author, knowing this, cannot have intended to limit compilation to such a hypothetical compiler. This is yet more evidence for an intent which agrees with the obvious interpretation of the language.  So, are you saying you honestly believe the author's intent was to block compilation of changes to his package altogether? If so, why distribute source at all? Furthermore, you believe that having this irrational intent, he then tried to hide it by using a word which *might* be interpreted to support his intent, but whose most obvious meaning contradicts it?  I find that a pretty implausible theory.  Your interpretation is distorts the license's original intent by using alternate meanings of words. As such it may even be semantically correct (that is, it may be within the set of possible semantic meanings of the utterance), but it is pragmatically incorrect (it is not the subset of that set that was meant by the author -- as we can tell from context). Intent is a matter of pragmatics[1] -- the study of situated utterances as evidence for meaning, not semantics[2] -- the study of isolated utterances for potential meaning.  You're pounding very hard on the semantics, trying to broaden the set of possible meanings, and you're not wrong about that as far as you go, but that's missing the point. The question was not ""what could this sentence possibly mean"", but ""what did this sentence mean when the author wrote it"" -- which is what actually matters legally.  The rest of the license, the fact of using the license, the fact of releasing software with source code and the consequences of licensing choices all provide situational information which supports the pragmatic interpretation of the sentence in question.  The fact that courts (or we) have to go beyond semantics to understand the license is a serious flaw of the license, which I've already pointed out, but as evidence of the author's actual intent, I think it is sufficient.

However, weak market fundamentals, including a sluggish economy and increased  US and Canadian supplies, will mitigate the usual winter price rise. CERA  expects an average Henry Hub price of $2.35 in November.  *  Although inventories are close to record levels, storage pressures are  increasingly unlikely to drive cash markets down significantly this year.   *  Gas demand will average 14 percent lower than a year earlier; residential  and commercial sectors show a decline with a return to normal weather, while a  weak economy offsets the return of ammonia and dual-fuel loads in the  industrial sector.  *  Regional storage inventories and weak regional demand should keep upward  pressure off of regional differentials.

I am sorry if you did not mean to bid $61, but it is hardly out of the range - these balls were selling this weekend for $80-90.  If your winning bid was $200 or higher I could understand your complaint and we could make an adjustment, but $61 is not an unreasonable amount.

But former CIA Director George Tenet lets loose in our first story in a public venting rare for any public official, never mind a CIA director. Tenet angrily accuses the Bush administration of ruining his reputation by misusing his now-famous ""slam dunk"" remark about Iraqi WMD to justify its march to war. ""It's the most despicable thing that ever happened to me,"" Tenet says. ""You don't do this. You don't throw somebody overboard just because it's a deflection. Is that honorable? It's not honorable to me,"" he tells correspondent Scott Pelley.  He also reveals in this double-length segment his anguish and frustration over the 9/11 attack, the first of the president's inner circle to provide a glimpse inside it during what many would consider the country's darkest hour in modern times. You'll hear and see his feelings on the hunt for Osama bin Laden, the war on terror and its ""enhanced interrogation"" methods he says were not torture and saved lives. Pressed by Pelley to explain why, if it wasn't torture,  these individuals had to have their interrogations ""enhanced,"" Tenet, leans forward to respond, ""Because these are people who will never, ever, ever tell you a thing. These are people who know who's responsible for the next terrorist attack....[who] wouldn't blink an eyelash about killing you, your family, me and my family and everybody in this town.""          Watch  An Excerpt Of Pelley's Report.     With the questions still hovering over the massacre at Virginia Tech last week, correspondent Steve Kroft explores perhaps the biggest irony in the horrible event. It's the fact that Seung-Hui Cho, with a history of mental illness, was still able to purchase the guns he used to kill 32 innocent people, despite a 40-year-old federal law prohibiting the sale of guns to the mentally ill. Kroft reports that the law isn't enforced because many states have laws that protect the privacy of the mentally ill, advocates for whom still want their records sealed and not shared with other government agencies. Even the NRA won't go that far. The sad fact is that Cho wasn't the first mentally ill person to kill with a gun he purchased freely, nor will he be likely the last.     Watch  Kroft's Reporter's Notebook.     These stories and some interesting items from Andy Rooney's mail bag, this Sunday, April 29, on 60 Minutes at 7 p.m. ET/PT.

legitimate,phishing,True,"[UAI] Submission Deadline Extended (June, 25): ICAPS PG'2007 Planning in Games [Apologies if you receive this CFP multiple times]  ====================================================================                       FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS           The ICAPS 2007 Workshop on Planning in Games              ICAPS PG 2007                  Providence, Rhode Island, USA                       September, 23, 2007             http://www.plg.inf.uc3m.es/icaps-pg2007/  Workshop Description: =====================  The two communities, planning and games, have coexisted for several decades, but have evolved with little interaction between them. While games programs have been engineered for efficiency from the early days, high-performance planners are a relatively recent development.  Both planning and games are important fields of research in the Artificial Intelligence community. A trend in the computer game community, exemplified in initiatives such as the General Game Playing Project and ORTS, has been on playing whole classes of games, and on increasing realism and complexity. This tests the limits of traditional game-tree search approaches. However, the planning community has a lot of experience in dealing with huge search spaces. Furthermore, such games also involve current topics of much current interest in planning, such as: time reasoning, resource management, imperfect information, cost-based planning, etc.  This workshop will discuss all aspects of using planning in the domain of games. Relevant topics include, but are not limited to:  - planning techniques for classical games - planning in commercial computer games - integration of planning and game tree search - representational issues: languages for planning in games - opportunities for technology transfer between the communities - competitions - planning stories and scenarios - planning and interactive narrative - integrating planning and affective systems - planning for NPCs - dialogue planning - reasoning about actions and game playing - plan recognition - learning plans  Important Dates: ================  Submission Deadline (extended):    June 25, 2007    11:59pm PST (Samoa time UTC-11)  Notifications and Technical Program:    July 13, 2007  Camera-Ready Paper Submissions:    July 31, 2007  Workshop Date:    September 23, 2007  Submission Procedure: =====================  We ask authors to submit technical papers in PDF format. Papers should be formatted in accordance with the AAAI style template and may be at most 8 pages long, including figures and bibliography. Visit the url http://www.aaai.org/Publications/Author/author.php for formatting instructions.

legitimate,phishing,True,"RHN Errata Alert: New kernel update available, fixes i810 video oops, several security issues Red Hat Network has determined that the following advisory is applicable to one or more of the systems you have registered: Complete information about this errata can be found at the following location:      https://rhn.redhat.com/network/errata/errata_details.pxt?eid=1159 Security Advisory - RHSA-2002:158-09 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Summary: New kernel update available, fixes i810 video oops, several security issues Updated kernel packages are now available which fix an oops in the i810 3D kernel code. This kernel update also fixes a difficult to trigger race in the dcache (filesystem cache) code, as well as some potential security holes, although we are not currently aware of any exploits. Description: The 2.4.18-5 kernel introduced some safety checks in the VM subsystem that were triggered when exiting an X session while using 3D acceleration with the Intel i810/i815 chipset. Additionally, there was a difficult to trigger race in the dcache of the file system subsystem. This kernel update addresses both of these issues. In addition, there are fixes for potential security holes in the following drivers: stradis rio500 se401 usbvideo apm Finally, this kernel fixes a few files in the /proc file system which had the capability to expose kernel memory when abused. All of the security issues found during an audit and none of them,  at the time of this writing, have any known exploits. We would like to thank Silvio Cesare, Stas Sergeev, Andi Kleen, Solar Designer, and others for their auditing work.
