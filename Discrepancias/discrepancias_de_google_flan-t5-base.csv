To fully leverage this new class of multi-core hardware, software developers must change the way they create applications. By turning their focus to multi-threaded applications, developers will be able to take full advantage of multi-core devices and deliver software that meets the demands of the world. But this paradigm of multi-threaded software development adds a new wrinkle of complexity for those who care the utmost about software quality.    Click Here to View This Whitepaper               Improving .NET Application Performance and Reliability with Managed Database Data Connectivity                Many .NET applications fail to meet user requirements because they do not provide optimal access to underlying Oracle, Sybase, or DB2 databases. The root cause is often unmanaged ADO.NET data providers shipped by the database vendor or from Microsoft. In this paper, SQL Server MVP and SSWUG co-founder Stephen Wynkoop explores common misperceptions about data access technologies, describes the optimum architecture for ADO.NET data providers, and highlights key selection criteria for developers.

legitimate,phishing,True,"[Ip-health] Economist: Drugs firms are rethinking their business model  http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9409230  Beyond the blockbuster Drugs firms are rethinking their business model   LIPITOR is a drugs company's dream. The cholesterol pill made by Pfizer, an American pharmaceuticals giant, is the world's best-selling drug. Last year it earned over $13 billion in revenues. Other hugely successful drugs include GlaxoSmithKline's Advair, an asthma remedy, and Plavix, a blood thinner, which is sold by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Sanofi-Aventis. Both enjoy billions of dollars in annual sales. Despite such rewards, however, pharmaceutical companies are reconsidering their pursuit of blockbuster drugs, as new technology permits the creation of niche remedies that target rare ailments or sub-populations of people suffering from common diseases.  That explains the $3 billion hostile takeover bid announced this week by Roche, a Swiss pharmaceutical firm, for Ventana Medical Systems, an American diagnostics firm. This year, Roche has gobbled up several diagnostics and genetic-testing firms making technologies that enhance the value of its targeted cancer therapies. The firm recently completed a $155m takeover of 454 Life Sciences, which makes gene-sequencing technology and last week spent some $273m on NimbleGen, which makes technologies used in identifying the genetic causes of disease.  Roche is being drawn away from conventional one-size-fits-all drugs partly by the allure of the lucrative new markets being created by the development of personalised medicine. But drugs giants are also victims of their own success. Blockbusters like Lipitor are already so effective, argues Tom Nagle of Monitor, a management consultancy, that it is difficult to come up with alternatives that are good enough to command a higher price.  Worse, many blockbusters are going off patent soon and pharmaceutical giants are finding it increasingly difficult to come up with new drugs to replace themdespite throwing pots of money at the problem (see chart). Makers of generic drugs are also growing more assertive in attacking patents. As a result of all this, reckons IMS, an industry consultancy, the industry saw a record $18 billion in branded sales collapse in 2006.  There are signs that long-term investors are growing concerned. A coalition of institutional investors representing over $1.1 trillion in assets, issued a report this month demanding a rethink of core business assumptions. Martin Eijgenhuijsen of ABP, a Dutch pension fund that is part of the coalition, says, We have serious doubts that the current business model can deliver targeted drugs. This requires radical change.  So is the industry ready to follow Roche's lead toward specialty products, targeted therapies and the like? The answer seems to be yes. Ray Hill of IMS calculates that although the vast mainstream market for chronic diseases like high blood pressure or diabetes is still important, specialty drugs accounted for nearly two thirds of total revenue growth last year, up from just a third in 2000. And only a quarter of drugs launched last year tackled chronic diseases, suggesting the pipeline is shifting toward targeted therapies.  For that trend, thank both technology and regulation. Anthony Farino of the consultancy arm of PricewaterhouseCoopers argues that such technologies as high-throughput sequencing, genomics and personal phenotyping, which were not available five years ago, are now transforming how drugs are discovered and tested. Ron Krall, GSK's chief medical officer, thinks the trick is identifying which patients will benefit most from new treatmentsor, equally usefully, which ones will have adverse reactions. To determine that, his firm has just opened a new facility in London run jointly with Imperial College and Hammersmith Hospital, where experimental drugs are tested. The micro-doses they administer to patients are analysed in real time by molecular scanners.  Regulators could play a decisive role in the large drugs companies' shifting strategies. The risk-averse stance they have taken since safety problems led Merck to recall its painkiller, Vioxx, may help propel the industry more rapidly away from blockbusters. Viren Mehta, an industry expert, speculates that although new drugs will always carry unknown risks, the regulatory burden might prove lighter for those aimed at specific, acute conditions (as opposed to ongoing maladies like diabetes). After all, he says, Fewer people are at risk for a shorter time.  Another regulatory boost may come from cost-benefit analysis that considers the long-term benefits, and not just the high price tags, of innovative new drugs. Britain's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has approved Herceptin, a targeted cancer drug, despite an annual cost per patient of nearly $50,000 because, in the words of Sir Michael Rawlins, NICE's chairman, it provides long-term value. NICE has also agreed to buy a cancer treatment made by Johnson & Johnson that has little effect on a third of patients, on the condition that it pay only when the drug works. And with an expensive Alzheimer's drug, the agency ruled that it would not pay for patients with the mildest form of dementia to take ita ruling that was challenged in a London court this week.  Such lawsuits are a sign that the transition to a new way of doing business carries risks. But as Graham Higson, head of regulatory affairs at AstraZeneca, a British drugs firm, notes: There's no such thing as no risk. The industry simply cannot continue developing drugs exactly the same way it has for 40 years. _______________________________________________ Ip-health mailing list Ip-health@lists.essential.org http://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health",0

legitimate,phishing,True,"Hi everybody!I'm writing a web application in java (tomcat + jsp/servlets + database  access with postgreSQL).This will be released under the GPL and will eventually be useful as a  framework for other web applications.The application main focus is e-commerce, but not limited to that.I would like to use some form of cryptography to protect data on the  database, but I have some problem figuring out the right approach.Above all, how to store passwords and keys in a shared web server.A problem that I was unable to solve is how to store keys for  encryption/decryption. The api that I'm using is the jca (jdk1.4.x),  and the methods of saving generated keys in keystores fails always. I can serialize the object, and store in the database, but this is not  the most secure approach: this key is needed to decrypt data in the  database, but the database is accessible from the web application.  Assuming that I can find a good and secure place where to store the  database password, I can use a different database with different  user... Argh... to complex and doesn't really solve the problem.Where I can found good documentation about this topic?There is another approach that I would share with the list, something I  thought that can be of bit interest, but probabily wrong and insecure.  After all, I'm a real beginner in secure programming, and I'm here to  learn methods and technics.First of all, I need a secure way to keep database passwords secure, so  I have to keep them separate from the main server. The right approach  could be using a small java bean application that run as normal user  (not tomcat, so it is not shared with other web services or, worst, the  nobody user), that has no shell login, but has a default home directory  or a place where it can hold passwords and keys.The web application could then open an ssl connection (could be done in  the init method at server startup) to get database passwords. The small  bean could check via code signature/rmi/whatever else that the source  is the right one, and handle all the database connections, or give the  db connection/password to the main web application.In this way, we solve the problem of keeping the keys and passwords in  shared directories, and also, an attacker should get root/bean user  account to read data. This is not perfect, and works only if your  provider gives the opportunity to configure a separated java  application (that means, really, another server running in the  background).Any suggestions?Thank you, Mario Torre --  Please avoid sending me Word or PowerPoint attachments.

legitimate,phishing,True,"re : transitional assignments all i have received a few notes about this since this one but i will try to respond to all questions here . please see below responses in red : enron capital sally - husband and 3 children - ages 15 , 11 and 2 ) . i understand that the houses which have been vacated due to returning expats have all been filled , so can you have someone arrange for corporate housing that will accommodate them ? i think the best way to go here is for us to use serviced apartments as it will be very difficult to find a lease for such a short period for this type of accommodation . my assistant , lisa , has put a call in to a service who can help us find serviced accommodation in south kensington / chelsea area or in dolphin square where we have people now who are very satisfied . is there a reason you are partial to south kensington / chelsea ? what if we find accommodation in another nice area of london within a short commute to the office ? when i have some options , i will let you know , probably on monday . immigration - due to the fact that they will be traveling back and forth and have made trips already , i feel it would be best to apply for work permits versus using the visa waiver . i have sent them the forms and requested that brent complete his and file immediately to increase chances of getting his sometime shortly after he arrives in the uk . i have informed him that he should arrive without his family if the permit has not been received by april 1 . brent ' s work permit will be submitted today and we may receive if before april lst , but it is unlikely . the way it works for this is as follows : brent will receive the work permit from us and if he is here , he will have to leave the uk and enter with the work permit for it to be validated . if his family are in houston , they will need to receive entry clearance in the us prior to arriving in the uk . this takes approx 7 working days and they will require either brent ' s original passport and work permit or a certified copy of each along with other things such as marriage and birth certificates . if brent decides to bring his family with him to london prior to receiving the work permit , they must say they are coming on a vacation for a short period of time and have a return ticket to back it up . once the permit is received , the family can either travel back to houston and submit the entry clearance visas there or they can all travel to amsterdam where they are currenlty issuing entry clearance without a problem . there is always a small element of risk in going to amsterdam , however , as do not have to issue the stamps there , they just do it because they are nice ! work permits are arriving approx 4 weeks from date of submission . we can discuss all of this on the 20 th . tax - please confirm whether paye will need to be paid for them during the short term assignment and then reclaimed through a treaty benefit . paye is due after 60 days ; however , if brent and sally are really only going to be here for approx 75 days , i am not going to inform the revenue that they are here . if this extends beyond the set time , we can look at options but the only responsiblility that brent and sally will have is to ensure they complete the tax organiser in order for us to get the tax back . also , as we would have to apply the treaty here , we need to ensure the salary costs stay in houston . jane , have you discussed this point ? benefits - i have suggested that they remain on us domestic payroll and benefits and , if medical claims arise that exceed what they would have spent in the us , they may claim the excess on the expense report . agreed . per diem - we need to discuss the appropriate amount based on family size . jane , please call me to discuss . i have left you a message , thanks let me know of any other issues we need to address . as always , i appreciate your help . jane",0

phishing,legitimate,True,"From Mr Cheung Pui TREAT AS URGENT FROM:MR.CHEUNG PUI Hang Seng Bank Ltd Sai Wan Ho Branch  171 Shaukiwan Road Hong Kong. e-mail address : cheung_pui1@hotmail.ro    Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr.Cheung Pui,director of operations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd,Sai Wan Ho Branch.I have a business proposal for you.  Before the U.S and Iraqi war,our client Major Fadi Basem who was with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war early this year. Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the Major and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.  After further investigation it was also discovered that Major Fadi Basem did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Twenty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the  laws of my country at the expiration 3 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem so that you will be able to receive his funds.   WHAT IS TO BE DONE:  I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary documents that will back you up as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem,all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the transfer of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.  There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue.Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me,25%for you,and 5% for any expenses incurred during the course of the operation. Should you be interested please send me your full names and current residential address and I will prefer you to reach me on the email address: cheung_pui1@hotmail.ro  Once i get your response to co-operate,i shall provide you with more details of this operation.  Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.  Kind Regards,  Mr.Cheung Pui     _________________________________________________________________",1

I understand that argument, but I do think it requires a leap of logic (or at least some creative interpretation) to get from the DFSG to this position. While I can see why some people do not want CDDL-licensed software in main for the above reason, I do not think it is fair to call it the Debian position that this is the case; at least not yet.  Counter-arguments: * The bit ""(except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides   otherwise)"" means you don't necessarily have to give up all your   rights. There are parts of copyright law in most jurisdictions that   give unalienable rights to users; those fall under the above   provision, by definition. The net result of your first clause   therefore may be, depending on circumstances, that users actually get   _more_ rights than what they started out with if that provision wasn't   there, because their own copyright law doesn't give them nearly as   much rights as the copyright law in the country where the software was   written would. * Your second quote is a non-issue. The same is true for GPL-licensed   software; if not, then why did we have to consult two lawyers back   when we moved crypto to main? And why do we still have such insane   procedures today when some crypto-using software gets through NEW?   (you don't see them because ftp-masters handle them, but they're still   there).  Additionally, personally I don't think it's unreasonable for people to say ""if you use my software in a way that I didn't want you to, I'll sue you in a court that works by a set of rules that I'm actually comfortable with"". You know, it makes fighting those who do not follow your license the way you intended them to quite a bit easier.  --  Shaw's Principle: 	Build a system that even a fool can use, and only a fool will 	want to use it.   --  To UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org with a subject of ""unsubscribe"".

Now, in the continuing economic    downturn,  foreign  workers  are  being  blamed  for  displacing their    homegrown counterparts.     Wednesday,  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., will introduce a bill crafted    to  close  loopholes  in  employment  visa  laws,  which he says allow    companies  to  hire  foreign  employees  and  outsource  them to other    companies.     ADVERTISEMENT     IFRAME:    http://ad.doubleclick.net/adi/eweek.dart/news;sz=336x280;ord=456641793    3?    [news;abr=!ie;sz=336x280;ord=4566417933?]      [ew_spacer.gif]     ""We must make sure that our immigration policies don't have a backlash    effect  on displacing American workers,"" Chambliss said Tuesday. ""[The    bill]  will  end the practice of companies who are displacing American    workers.""     The  Senate  Judiciary  Committee  Tuesday  took a look at the role of    temporary work visas in the current economy. The technology industry's    use  of  H-1B  visas  dropped approximately 75 percent last year, with    initial  H-1B visa applications falling to 26,659 in 2002 from 105,692    in  2001,  according  to the Department of Homeland Security Office of    Immigration Security.     Despite  the  statistics,  as unemployment rises in the United States,    lawmakers are hearing from their constituents.     ""I  cannot  tell  you  how  many  workers  came up to me [in August in    California]  and  said, 'I've been replaced by somebody I trained, and    they're  getting  a  third  [the  salary] of what I got,'"" Sen. Dianne    Feinstein,  D-Calif.,  said  at  a  hearing  of  the  Senate Judiciary    Committee  Tuesday. ""Wherever I go, this program comes up and somebody    tells me they've been replaced, and they are angry.""     Intel  Corp.,  which  employs close to 80,000 workers worldwide, hires    individuals  through  the  H1-B  visa program when a position requires    unique  or  difficult-to-find  skills,  Patrick Duffy, human resources    attorney  at Intel, told lawmakers. Beginning in 2001, Intel decreased    hiring  overall,  but  it  continues  to  hire H-1B applicants when it    cannot  find  qualified  U.S.  workers,  Duffy  said.  The company has    particular difficulty hiring U.S. citizens for positions in electrical    engineering design and chemical engineering, he said.     Duffy  contended  that  the  H-1B  visa program does not displace U.S.    workers  and  ultimately  benefits  the  U.S.  economy.  Most  of  the    company's  H-1B visa employees studied at U.S. universities and earned    masters degrees and doctorates.     ""These are not temporary workers to us. The H-1B visa is just one step    in  making these workers U.S. workers,"" Duffy said. ""Hopefully they'll    stay with Intel ... the rest of their lives.""     Large  corporations  that  rely  on skilled foreign workers are urging    Congress  not  to pass short-term fixes that will later cause problems    when  the  economy  recovers.  In  the  boom  times  of the late '90s,    Ingersoll-Rand  Corp. had to take people off the payroll when the H-1B    hiring  cap  was  lowered,  Elizabeth Dickson, adviser for Immigration    Services  at  Ingersoll-Rand  in  Woodcliff Lake, N.J., told lawmakers    Tuesday.     ""When  the [foreign worker hiring] cap reverts to 65,000, we are going    to  have a lot of problems that we experienced both in 1997 and 1998,""    Dickson  said.  ""If  we  have a recovering economy, what are our needs    going to be long term?""     The  root of the problem, according to the industry officials, is that    Americans  earn too few graduate degrees in the hard sciences, leaving    the  domestic  pool of adequate engineering specializations too small.    Contrary  to some assertions, industry officials said they do not hire    foreign  workers  to  pay  them  less  than  they would pay Americans.    Dickson  told  lawmakers  that  it  is  more expensive to hire foreign    workers.     ""We  are  mostly  looking  to  hire U.S. workers. They're cheaper, and    there  are  a  lot  less problems,"" Dickson said. ""In the near term we    simply must have access to foreign nationals. If we want to maintain a    global edge, we want to have the best and the brightest working for us    in the United States.""     American  engineers  argue  that corporate America's use of H-1B visas    exacerbates the problem of engineering unemployment. Abuse of the visa    program,  in  particular,  leaves  qualified  Americans  out  of work,    according  to  John  Steadman,  president-elect  of  the  IEEE-USA  in    Washington, D.C.     ""If  we  continue  down  this path, the United States is making itself    increasingly  dependent  of foreign technical expertise, both here and    abroad,""  Steadman  told  lawmakers,  urging the government to support    programs  that  encourage  more  students--especially  minorities  and    women--to go into the sciences.",0

legitimate,phishing,True,"sddp model john , attached is a copy of the sddp methodology manual , written by the developers . the model was developed by mario pereira , who is the proprietor of psri ( power systems research inc ) in rio de janeiro . their web site is : www . psr - inc . com where you can find more information about the company and contact details . mario and most of the staff speak english , so phone calls are possible . development of sddp was originally done on a world bank contract to compare the benefits of new generation and transmission system interconnections in central america . it has since found much wider application . the code runs on a pc , and is licensed to a number of consultants , power companies , etc . while i was with ecnz in wellington , new zealand , we purchased a copy around 1994 . the model works with weekly or monthly time steps , with a time horizon of from 1 to 10 years , for mid to long range planning of hydro thermal power systems . it represents loads in each period as from one to five load blocks , so it is not a chronological model . this type of model can not handle thermal plant ramp rates and similar chronological system constraints . i ' m not sure how important that would be to you . the optimization phase of the model takes into account hydrological uncertainty using a form of stochastic dynamic programming with sampling . this phase sets up a function for water value in each large reservoir in the system . the simulation phase uses a number of hydrological outcomes to collect statistics on how the system would operate . the water values can be used with the short term optimization mode of sddp or in some other more detailed short term optimization model . most constraints found in hydro systems can be modelled . many transmission constraints can be modelled . a dc load flow option can be used to determine bus nodal prices . a visual basic user interface is provided which reads and writes text files . if you ' d like to know more about sddp , you could call me here in houston .

legitimate,phishing,True,"[Ip-health] USA for Innovation letter to Congress http://www.usaforinnovation.org/news/050907_USAFI_Adelman%20Letter.pdf  Ambassador Kenneth L. Adelman, Executive Director USA For Innovation P.O. Box 57052 Washington, DC 20037-7052  May 9, 2007  Members of Congress United States of America  Dear Member of Congress:  I wish to bring to your immediate attention the recent attacks on American intellectual property being perpetrated by Brazil and Thailand. These attacks endanger the basis of American prosperity, innovation, and jobs. Unless vigorous measures are taken soon, such attacks are likely to spread to other countries, to the further detriment of U.S. national interests.  Last Friday, Brazils President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva issued a ""compulsory license"" to override the U.S. patent on an AIDS drug made by Merck. Obviously, this measure undercuts future research and development on medical innovation, upon which the health of millions around the world depend.  The public rationale given by the governments of Thailand and Brazil to override the property rights of foreign firms is invalid. Issuing a compulsory license in this manner is considered by USA for Innovation to be illegitimate under World Trade Organization rules, indisputably bad policy, and dangerous precedent.  When Brazil and Thailand issue compulsory licenses, they signal to the world their unwillingness to respect international patent protection. If this grows into more of a trend  which it will, unless strongly resisted -- innovators will no longer choose to provide life-saving drugs and other medicines in these countries.  Moreover, such a move is short-sighted for the countries themselves. It hurts local firms in Brazil and Thailand trying to attract foreign investment. It hurts their patients, who will no longer have access to patented medicines which, in many cases, are the only treatments proven safe and effective.  Thailand and Brazil have no excuse for their behavior. They are not poor countries, and cannot claim to be in crisis. Thailands GDP ranks it among the top 10% wealthiest countries in the world, and its government spends little on health care. The World Health Organization notes that Thailand spends far less on health care (3.3% of GDP) than peers such as Argentina (8.9%) or poorer countries like Cambodia (10.9%) or Lebanon (10.2%). The United States spends 15.2%.  What is true in Thailand is even truer of Brazil. It is not only in the top 10% of richest countries in the world, but in the top 5%. While Brazil spends a greater percentage of its GDP on health (7.6%) than Thailand, it is still half of what America spends.  In attacking intellectual property rights of American and European companies, Brazil and Thailand threaten innovation, which is the lifeblood of our economy. In this age of globalization, U.S. intellectual property is our comparative advantage.  A 2005 study by two leading economists  the Democratic, Clinton-appointee Dr. Robert Shapiro and Republican advisor Dr. Kevin Hassett -- estimates that U.S. intellectual property is worth between $5 trillion and $5.5 trillion. This equals approximately 45% of the U.S. GDP, and is greater than the GDP of any other nation in the world.  Intellectual property accounts for about one-quarter of all business investment over the last decade. Intangibles now account for nearly two-thirds of the market value of large U.S. public companies.  As importantly, nearly 3 million American jobs depend on continued investment in biopharmaceuticals. The world benefits from the life-saving results produced by these American scientists, researchers, doctors and teachers. More than 70% of all world medicines are created by Americans. International refusal to pay for these products not only threatens millions of American jobs, it endangers our ability to produce the new medical treatments the ailing around the world need most desperately.  Both Brazil and Thailand enjoy extraordinary benefits from Americans. While American workers face expensive tariffs when exporting goods and services to these countries (including, incredibly, taxes and tariffs on medical products), both Brazil and Thailand receive generous treatment when sending their products to the U.S. under the Generalized System of Preferences.  Both countries also receive a host of military, humanitarian and other forms of assistance from the U.S. government, in addition to private donations from millions of American charities. It seems appropriate to remind leaders of these countries that the United States will protect innovation-producing American firms and jobs. Doing so now, in a vigorous manner, will save lives in these countries and throughout the world.  Sincerely yours,  Kenneth L. Adelman, Executive Director USA For Innovation     -- Mike Palmedo Research Coordinator Program on Information Justice and Intellectual Property American University, Washington College of Law 4910 Massachutsetts Ave., NW Washington, DC 20016 T - 202-274-4442 | F 202-274-0659 mpalmedo@wcl.american.edu   _______________________________________________ Ip-health mailing list Ip-health@lists.essential.org http://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health",0

legitimate,phishing,True,"Bike Diary #6 Day 13 Date: Thursday July 5, 2001 Distance: 85 miles Moving average speed: 13.1 mph Left at: 8:00 AM Arrived at: 4:00 PM Overnight in: cyclist shelter in Monroeville, IN Latitude 40 d 58 m 7 s N Longitude 84 d 51 m 55 s W Cumulative distance: 1058 miles  Today I passed two major milestones: I crossed another state border (Ohio to Indiana, and yes, I took that picture of the sign), and I logged my 1000th mile.  Now it's easy to extrapolate forward: if I covered 1000 miles in 13 days then I should cover 4000 miles in 52 days, which is 7 weeks and 3 days, within the range of my 6-to-8 week predeparture prediction.  52 days from my starting date (June 23) is August 13.  I would estimate the error on that prediction to be +/- 4 days, on the grounds that I added 1 day of riding to the first 1000 miles to nurse an injured knee, which extrapolates to 4 days over 4000 miles.  The weather today was fine, sunny with a high in the 70s, and the riding conditions would have been perfect were it not for the damn headwind.  It was from the northwest this time, so I could get a  little component of it behind me every time my route turned a little bit south.  But along the stretches of roads aligned due west it was a real grind.  I should digress on the subject of that headwind.  If I could have a nickel for every time somebody has told me that I am riding the ""wrong way"" across the country because the prevailing winds blow from west to east, then I would start getting invited to Bill Gates' parties.  Generally speaking, my interlocutors do not even appreciate the full difficulty of riding from east to west, because not only are the prevailing winds against you, but so are the prevailing hills.  You may recall from a previous Bike Diary entry my discussion of why it is that one should always prefer to go gradually down hill as opposed to an exhilerating rapid descent that squanders all the energy gained from climbing into wind resistance (this is not my opinion, it is a fact of physics).  Well, if you think about it, Denver is a mile high (5000 feet above sea level), but still east of the Front Range of the Rockies.  The Mississippi River, on the other hand, is only a few hundred feet above sea level.  This is true everywhere as you approach the Rockies from the east (for example, Cut Bank, MT on my route is just short of 4000 feet elevation).  Therefore, going west across the great plains you are gradually climbing, only to rapidly descend again when you get across the continental divide. The eastbounders, on the other hand, get the benefit of playing out their altitude gain gradually over a long distance as they descend across the great plains.  So, why go west?  Personally, I feel that flying to the west coast and bicycling back is the moral equivalent of getting air lifted to the top of Everest, skiing down to the base camp and then claiming to have climbed the mountain.  It is as if you wanted the bragging rights to say you rode your bicycle across the country, but you wanted to obtain them with the least amount of exertion necessary.  If you live on the east coast, and you want to ride across the continent, it seems perfectly obvious to me that what you need to do is ride west.  One should not undertake such a project as this if you want to do something easy.  OK, end of tirade.  Just remember this the next time you meet someone who claims to have bicycled across the country: the westbounders are the real cyclists.  Speaking of westbounders, I may be closing in on some ahead of me. I stopped in at the bicycle store in Defiance, OH to see if they had any news of westbounders.  Apparently a couple, short in stature, had passed through four days ago.  I wonder if this is the same couple making a perimeter tour that I heard about from the scruffy eastbounder on route 20 in upstate NY (see Day 4, Bike Diary #2).  If so, they were 8-9 days ahead of me then and are only 4 days ahead of me now, so I may be closing the gap.  In 10 days I've gained 4 on them, with 4 more to go, so I would guess that I will probably catch up to them in another 10 days, around July 15.  Stay tuned.  I'm spending tonight in Monroeville, IN.  Monroeville is like the set of a Frank Capra movie: you have your supper in the Village Cafe (two fried pork chops with mashed potatoes and gravy and a side salad for six bucks) and a chocolate malted from the Whippy Dip for dessert. The clientele of the Whippy Dip is a small crowd of flirting teenagers, there's a little league baseball game going on the playing field in the city park, and after dark the fireflies come out in swarms. You may have thought that places like this didn't exist any more, but here in middle America civil small town life is alive and well. You don't lock up your bike and you don't worry about it, either.  My accomodation here in Monroeville is a pavillion in the city park that has been set up as a shelter specifically for long distance touring cyclists.  There's a small bathroom with every imaginable amenity from warm shower to washer/dryer for your laundry.  The hospitable residents of Monroeville expect nothing in return: you can leave a donation but there's no obligation.  There's a guest book where you can leave your name, starting point and destination, and from the list of names it appears that Monroeville is a popular destination for touring cyclists: there's a few coming through every couple of days. I scanned the list for evidence of westbounders ahead of me to no avail.  Day 14 Date: Friday July 6, 2001 Distance: 83 miles Moving average speed: 14.1 mph Left at 7:30 AM Arrived at 2:30 PM Overnight in Salamonie River State Forest near Wabash, IN Latitude 40 d 48 m 42 s N Longitude 85 d 41 m 53 s W Cumulative distance: 1141  Although I rode 83 miles today, I only advanced 56 along the route to Seattle.  There were two reasons for the extra 27 miles today, the first was an inadvertent detour first thing in the morning when I left Monroeville headed in the wrong direction.  Here's and important fact for you future trans-America cyclists to remember: the sun rises in the east and sets in the west.  Therefore, if you are navigating the midwestern grid on a sunny morning thinking that you are going west but you do not see your shadow in front of you, then something is terribly wrong. It took me about three or four miles to notice this discrepancy, miles which I had to double back, of course.  The second detour was up to Fort Wayne to pick up some mail that my friends Maria and Kate sent me (thanks Kate! thanks Maria!).  I love mail.  The rest of the day was full of county roads and cornfields in Indiana. The wind more or less behaved itself today, starting the morning from the southeast before settling back into its usual pattern of coming from the southwest.  It wasn't much of a wind in either direction, maybe 5-10 mph.  I could easily have made it a longer day, but there is a real scarcity of services along this particular stretch of the route.  The next campground is 38 miles farther on, and there isn't a motel in the next 87 miles.  I probably could have managed the 38 miles to the next campground, but in deference to my still aching knees I quit much earlier in the afternoon than I would normally.  It looks like I made an impressively early start today, but that turns out to be a bit of a trick.  Although most of Indiana is in the eastern time zone, the state does not observe daylight savings time (except for the part in the cental time zone, just for maximum confusion) so at this time of year I crossed into the central time zone for all practical purposes when I crossed the Indiana border.  My campground tonight is a ""primitive facility"" which translates to no shower and pit toilets.  Generally speaking, I don't much mind primitive campgrounds as they are generally alot emptier than the ones that cater to the RV crowd and provide full hookups (water and electrical).  This one is an exception to that rule: there's hardly a vacant site.  I suppose it must be because of the holiday weekend since there isn't anything terribly exciting to do in the neighborhood. Most of the other campers are sitting in their sites experimenting  with all the noise-making gear they have brought along (firecrackers, car stereos, bongo drums, you name it).  Oh well, after all these days on the road I think I could sleep through anything.  Day 15 Date: Saturday July 7, 2001 Distance: 86 miles Moving average speed: 12.1 mph Left at 9:30 AM Arrived at 6:15 PM Overnight in White House B&B in Rensselaer, IN Latitude 40 d 55 m 52 s N Longitude 87 d 9 m 6 s W Cumulative distance: 1227 miles  I awoke this morning at 5 AM (EST) to the sound of distant thunder.  At first, I didn't realize that it was thunder I was hearing.  I'm accustomed to thunder as an intermitent booming; the sound I hear this morning was a continuous background.  After I had ruled out military aircraft on manueovers as a possible source for the sound I heard, I realized that I was in big trouble.  My immediate thought was ""strike the tent and seek shelter"".  That probably seems strange to alot of people who figure that the tent IS shelter, but you may recall from my first night's experience that if the tent is pitched on a slope, then it provides precious little shelter from runoff soaking through the floor of the tent.  I had once again pitched the tent on a slope, not expecting rain.  In fact, it seemed that most of the folks in the campground were not expecting (or at least prepared for) the rain that came.  By 6 AM I had my gear stowed my gear and loaded on the bicycle, and I moved myself and the bicycle to the only shelter on the campground: a pavillion that protected, ironically enough, the campground's water supply. The water supply itself was nothing but a spigot, but it spilled into a catch basin that looked like it came out of a coroner's office: it was a shallow sink no wider than usual but long enough to lay down in.  The pavillion overhangs this sink by three or four feet on any side, therefore the entire sheltered area was no bigger than about eight by ten feet.  At 6:10 AM the rains came with a vengance.  I cannot remember the last time I saw such torrential rain and so much lightning.  I believe that more than four inches of rain fell during the next three and a half hours, with lightning hitting very close to where I was standing.  I now could under- stand why the distant thunder had been continuous, because I was now standing in the middle of it.  And there I stood, for about three and a half hours, making light conversation with some of the other campers who dared step out in the storm and waiting for it to end.  One guy seemed to have an unnaturally detailed knowledge of the roads and motels of Indiana; when I asked him what line of work he was in he said he was following power lines.  Apparently utilities hire these guys to go around the state following the power lines to make sure there are no trees nearby that threaten to fall on them.  At 9:30 AM it was clear that the worst of the storm had passed and I decided to head out and make the most of what was left of the day. I'm pretty much ready to get out of Indiana, having already spent more time crossing Ohio than I had hoped.  The day started out as a more or less routine one of grinding out miles across cornfields.  The wind was quite strong in the aftermath of the storm, but it had returned to its normal direction (southwest), so I concluded that the rain was probably over for the day.  The weather was hot and humid, and the pace pretty slow.  I ran into some eastbounders in Denver, IN.  I wouldn't have recognized them as tourists because they were travelling on unloaded bikes, but one of them stopped to talk to me.  They are a group of three men in their late 50s/early 60s doing the Northern Tier in sections while somebody's wife drives the camper/sag-wagon behind.  Boy, these guys have it easy: not only are they eastbound but supported as well!  And he had the nerve to complain to me about headwinds!  ""Take a look at that flag"" I said.  My goal for today after I realized that it would be abbreviated by rain was to make it to Rensselaer, IN.  I'm passing through a part of Indiana where the campgrounds are scarce (and so is the population), so I had to shoot for a town with a motel.  Upon, arriving in Rensselaer, I was greeted by a parade of hot-rods (in fact, some locals had stopped me about two miles from town to warn me that it was happening today). I would estimate that there was well over one hundred cars in the parade, and after it was over they proceeded to cruise the town revving engines and peeping tires much to the delight of the townsfolk, who had turned out to the last man to observe the spectacle.  I suppose this is some sort of July Forth weekend event that happens every year.  I ended up picking the B&B for the night since the only other option was a motel on the interstate.  It might have been cheaper, but I would really hate staying on an interstate strip four miles outside of town.  At least this way I could walk around town and watch the cars go by.  I think I was making slightly better time on foot than the cruisers were, but maybe that's their point.",0

Might take a day or so to stabilize.      cheers, jerry -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1.4.3 (GNU/Linux) Comment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org  iD8DBQFGPlieIR7qMdg1EfYRAo0eAKCmjNX17wgQPAxBjvHLjSqmUwXnZACfeYlF lIt/uKM04MdZegAy+sdgqik= =Vv50 -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----",0

phishing,legitimate,True,"IN GOOD FAITH  Dear Friend,  Good day to you. I may have to trouble your sense of personal achievement and reward for an opportunity properly taken advantage of.  I am Mr. Michael Ramsey, a representative and attorney to Kenneth Lay, the former chairman & CEO, Enron Corp. Industry: Energy &Natural Resources Home, presently in jail and facing trial on charges of corruption and embezzlement of funds while in Power. He deposited ($21,000,000.00) with me when he was in power as the chairman.   I am contacting you because I want you to deal with the Finance house and claim the money on my behalf since I have declared that the Funds belong to my foreign business partner. You shall also be required to assist me in investment in your country. I hope to trust you as a God fearing person who will not sit on this money when you claim it, rather assist me properly, share in this percentage, 60% to me and 40% to you. When I receive your positive response I will give you viable information relating to this project i.e. the Finance institution where the money was deposited and the required documentation that will enable you lay claims to the funds, which is very important. What I need is for you to indicate your interest that you will assist us by receiving the money on my behalf in Europe. For this, you shall be considered to be the beneficiary to the funds. The project in brief, is that the funds with which we intend to carry out our proposed investments in your country, is presently in the custody of a bank in Europe. I do not want the government of my Country to know about the money because they will believe I got the money from the sales of Enron stock when he was the Chairman & C.E.O.of Enron   Once I have your details in full, the finance institution will contact you for Release of the funds to your account. As soon as payment is effected, and the amount mentioned above is successfully transferred into your account, I intend to use my own share in acquiring some estates abroad. For this too you shall also be the overseas manager of all our properties and you will be paid based on a certain percentage agreed on by both parties. I guarantee you that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Please get in touch with me urgently by E-mail:mr2001@faithmail.com.

phishing,legitimate,True,"GOOD DAY... Dear Friend,  I am Mr.Vincent Nicholas, I am an accountant with the HSBC BANK UK.I am very sorry if this is an inconvinience in any way, just that i need you to see me through with this transfer. This business request may seem strange, but I crave your indulgence and pray you view it seriously as I am convinced that you would be capable to provide me with a solution to a money transfer.  On June 16, 2000, a German property magnate Mr. Andrea Schranner made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months,valued at 6,500,000.00(Six Million Five Hundred Thousand Pounds Sterling )in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers (the Petroleum Corporation) that Mr. Andrea Schranner died in an air crash with his family.  On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a will and attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Andrea Schranner did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork. This sum of 6,500,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the  principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it .According to British law, at the expiration of 7 years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Bristish Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Mr. Andrea Schranner. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that an accredited Attorney working with the bank here will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin.We shall employ the service of two attorneys for the drafting and notarization of the will and obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate administration in your favour for the transfer into any bank account in any part of the world which you will provide.We will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.The money will be paid into your account for us to share in ratio of  50% for me and 30% for you and 10 % will be set aside to ofset any expenses incured during the business , while the other 10% will go to charity organisation. There is no risk at all,the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as an accountant in the bank with the help of the branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.

phishing,legitimate,True,"URGENT REPLY PLEASE. Dear Friend,  Attention Please.   Sorry to disturb you. I am Dr Idris Ali, the Director in charge of Auditing  and Accounting section of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B) Ouagadougou  Burkina-faso West Africa. With due respect and regard. I have decided to  contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both  of us at the end of the transaction .   During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came  across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a  plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank  without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or  relation before our discovery to this development.   The said amount was U.S 7.5M (Seven Million,Five Hundred Thousand United  States Dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive  information through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole arrangement  to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get  the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been  put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as  soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist, and also  benefit your self to this great business opportunity.   In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this  country as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign  account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of  transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will  require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin  with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign  account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his  request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the  correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from  to your own designation bank account.   I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On  smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the  total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of  expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and  internet bills, while 60% will be for me and my coleagues. Please, you have  been adviced to keep ""Top Secret"" as I am still in service and intend to  retire from service after we conclude this deal with you.   I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm  the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for  subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated  and further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us  to invest in. All other necessary vital nformation will be sent to you when  I hear from you.   I look forward to receive your phone and fax numbers for easy communication,   Yours faithfully,   Dr Idris Ali.  _________________________________________________________________ Windows Live Messenger : venez tester la version bta !  http://www.ideas.live.com/programpage.aspx?versionId=5d21c51a-b161-4314-9b0e-4911fb2b2e6d",1

phishing,legitimate,True,"FROM MRS BINTU OMAR  Dear friend,   With warm heart I offer my friendship and greetings and I hope this letter meets you in good time. However strange or surprising this contact might seem to you as we have Not met personally or had any dealings in the past, I Humbly ask that you take due consideration of its Importance and the immense benefit it will be to you.   After careful consideration with my Son, we resolved to contact you for your most needed assistance in this manner. I duly apologize for infringing on your privacy, if this contact is not acceptable to you, as I make this proposal to you as a person of integrity. For the purpose of introduction, I am Mrs Bintu Omar the wife of late Brigadier Barham Omar from Zimbabwe currently hiding in South Africa as refugees. My husband severed in the ZANU PF Government lead by Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe.   He operated in Mozambique, Angola, and Congo formerly Zaire lead by Mubutu Seseseko, during this period He was used as a confidante's by Robert Mugabe and his hierarchy to carry out their shady deals of smuggling Diamonds and gold from mines which were situated in areas controlled by Zimbabwean soldiers.   During this period he managed to accumulate a personal fortune of US$10,000,000 (TEN Million United States Dollars) which he secretly Lodged with a security and finance company here in South Africa as 'precious Stones"" because of the fear of my country president Robert Mugabe   Before the 2002 presidential election in Zimbabwe my husband defected to the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) because he defied an order to send a contingent of his battalion to go and attack innocent white farmers for refusing to give up their land, as a result of that and because of the position my husband held and the secret duties that he executed for ZANU PF he was put under surveillance by the central intelligence organisation and Mugabe's secret police. He was caught and thrown into the prison and later he was killed by Robert Mugabe and is partners Before his death, he managed to smuggle out a letter to me intimating me about the existence of the sum, which he deposited with the security and finance company in South Africa, which he acquired during his operations for president Robert Mugabe and ZANU PF Because of the strong relationship existing between the current South Africa Government and Zimbabwean Government it is increasingly becoming too risky for me and my Son to remain in South Africa. As a result of this I am seeking your assistance to help us (me and my son) clear this fund and deposit it in your personal account in your country for our investment..   For your assistance (I and my Son) is prepared to give you 15% of the total sum as compensation, and 5% is set aside to settle any expenses that we might incur during the cause of clearing and transferring this fund to your nominated account, while the remaining 80% will be for us (I and my Son), for our investment in your company, under your supervision and with you as our fund manager.   What I need from you is as follows:-   a)Your honesty that you will not run away with our money.  b) Your contacts details such as Fax /Telephone and mobile numbers for easy communication.   For more information regarding this transaction, I would appreciate if you contact my son (Ahmed Omar) through his phone number +27-83 8686 990 or email:(barhamomar@hotmail.com) Immediately you receive this letter for more briefings and details.   Your urgent response is highly needed.   Best regards,   MRS BINTU OMAR  (for the family)",1

Based on that I can make these guesses:   X-Spam-Score seems to be score *10, and truncated instead of rounded.  This accounts for how -6.6 can become -65.. (-6.58 will round to -6.6,  but multiply and truncate and you get -65)  X-Spam-Bar probably generates a series of - or + signs for each full  point of score in that direction. (similar to SA's _STARS(*)_ tag, but  with negative scores represented). It's a wild guess, but seems reasonable.",0

New plant  plus significantly reduced summer demand through conservation has put the  West's capacity margin at 15 percent, but regional balances vary widely. Power  demand declines have also completely relieved the West Coast gas supply  shortfall. Despite low hydroelectric output, gas demand for power generation in  the West is actually down from last year.  *  Energy conservation in response to the retail price increase, cool weather,  and the slowing economy is the strongest fundamental driver in California.   *  New power supplies have arrived, but grid operators cannot count on full  nameplate capacity within the first few months of a new plant's start date.  *  Pacific Northwest hydroelectric resources remain critically low despite low  demand, raising the specter of reliability problems this winter.  **end**  Follow above URL for complete Monthly Briefing (9 printed pages).

phishing,legitimate,True,"letter from smith Direct and private cell number +447024075280 Direct and private Telephone + 448714749902 Direct and private fax number + 448701310683 Dear Friend,  I am Mr. T. smith, deputy senior regional manager at Lloyds TSB Commercial Finance in Yorkshire. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 2000, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit  for forty-eight months, (being four years) valued at US$40,000,000.00, (forty Million, Dollars) in my branch.  Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his employers, that Mr. Barry Kelly died from tsunami on his holidays in Thailand 26 December 2004. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$40,000,000 has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for Safekeeping .No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to British Law, at the expiration of (three) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the British Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to stand in as the owner  of the money I deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes though  the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as I tagged them to be photographic materials for export.

phishing,legitimate,True,"share with me  From : Mr Jainakai Liu Dah Sing Bank Ltd, Mei Foo Sun Chuen Branch Kowloon, Hong Kong,  I am Mr.Liu Jiankai, Head Private Banking of Dah Sing Bank Ltd. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.  On November 8th, 2001, an American consultant/contractor with the Chinese Rail Corporation, Mr. Morris a private business man unfortunately Lost his life in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31st 2000, including his wife and only daughter.You can read more about the crash on visiting these sites below,  1. http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list 2.http://www.nativefederation.org/history/people/mThompson.html  Before the plane crash, Mr. Morris Thompson made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months with a value of US$14,300,000.00 (Fourteen Million Three Hundred thousand Dollars only) in my branch.Upon maturity,I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.  After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Hong Kong Rail Corporation that Mr. Morris Thompson died from a Air Plane crash accident. On further investigation,I found out that he died with his family, and also without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.  I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Morris Thompson did not declare any other kin or relations in all his official documents apart from his wife and daughter,whom also died in the said crash,including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$14,300,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Laws of Hong Kong, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Morris Thompson so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin.  The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 65% for me and 30% for you and 5% for Expenses Incurred in the course of the transaction . There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and with my position as the Head Private Banking guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately to my email. liujiankai@kaixo.com Upon your response,  I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. You should observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.  Awaiting your urgent reply.  Thanks and regards.

legitimate,phishing,True,"[UAI] Submission Deadline Extended (June, 25): ICAPS PG'2007 Planning in Games [Apologies if you receive this CFP multiple times]  ====================================================================                       FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS           The ICAPS 2007 Workshop on Planning in Games              ICAPS PG 2007                  Providence, Rhode Island, USA                       September, 23, 2007             http://www.plg.inf.uc3m.es/icaps-pg2007/  Workshop Description: =====================  The two communities, planning and games, have coexisted for several decades, but have evolved with little interaction between them. While games programs have been engineered for efficiency from the early days, high-performance planners are a relatively recent development.  Both planning and games are important fields of research in the Artificial Intelligence community. A trend in the computer game community, exemplified in initiatives such as the General Game Playing Project and ORTS, has been on playing whole classes of games, and on increasing realism and complexity. This tests the limits of traditional game-tree search approaches. However, the planning community has a lot of experience in dealing with huge search spaces. Furthermore, such games also involve current topics of much current interest in planning, such as: time reasoning, resource management, imperfect information, cost-based planning, etc.  This workshop will discuss all aspects of using planning in the domain of games. Relevant topics include, but are not limited to:  - planning techniques for classical games - planning in commercial computer games - integration of planning and game tree search - representational issues: languages for planning in games - opportunities for technology transfer between the communities - competitions - planning stories and scenarios - planning and interactive narrative - integrating planning and affective systems - planning for NPCs - dialogue planning - reasoning about actions and game playing - plan recognition - learning plans  Important Dates: ================  Submission Deadline (extended):    June 25, 2007    11:59pm PST (Samoa time UTC-11)  Notifications and Technical Program:    July 13, 2007  Camera-Ready Paper Submissions:    July 31, 2007  Workshop Date:    September 23, 2007  Submission Procedure: =====================  We ask authors to submit technical papers in PDF format. Papers should be formatted in accordance with the AAAI style template and may be at most 8 pages long, including figures and bibliography. Visit the url http://www.aaai.org/Publications/Author/author.php for formatting instructions. Please submit papers via email to ombquvcukfr-kn6862@lab.inf.uc3m.es  Please note that all submitted papers will be carefully peer-reviewed by multiple reviewers, and that low-quality or off-topic papers will not be accepted.

phishing,legitimate,True,"st0ck rum0rs that bec0me true and pr0fitable Bio-Matrix Scientific Gr0up, Inc.  Symbo|: BMXG.PK Industry: Biotechno|ogy; Stem Cel| Techno|ogies. Current Price: .85 Shares Out.: 8.0 Million Est. F|oat: 2.5 Mi|lion  Projected Valuation: 3.5O per share   Bio-Matrix Scientific- Banking on Stem Cel| Research.  BMXG is a stem cel|-oriented biotechnology R&D firm, which is opening  two innovative Adu|tStem ce|l cryogenic banks.  Cryobanks wi|l provide  near-term revenue stream whi|e BMXG develops new and innovative stem  cell technologies and products.   The Stem Cel| Revo|ution:  With breakthroughs in the |ate 1990's, stem cel| research has been one  of the most exciting deve|opments in biotechno|ogy, promising to aid in  the treatment or cure of degenerative and chronic diseases, including  |eukemia, cancer, and diabetes.  Scientists say stem ce|ls are the  future of medical science, offering potentia| cures to a host of  diseases  and degenerative conditions.  Market research firm, visiongain has  estimated that stem cel| products wi|l account for over 1O bil|ion in  annual  sales by 2O13- phenomenal growth for an industry which did not exist  on|y a few years ago.  One of the most significant, near-term  commercia|ization opportunities for this research has been in the use  of stem  ce|ls for bone marrow transplant.  Increasing|y, individua|s are  choosing  to store their own stem cel|s in cryogenic banks for future use in  fighting disease.  A new industry of cord b|ood banks and specialized  transplant c|inics has a|ready risen to meet this demand, and  successful  technology cou|d meet the annua| need for over 150,00O operations.  Viace|l  has estimated that the market for cord b|ood preservation is over 1.2  bi|lion in the US, and 2 bil|ion globa||y.  For our most recent Active Trader's profi|e, we have discovered a smal|  rapidly emerging company that is quick|y becoming a major player in the  stem cel| revolution, Bio-Matrix Scientific.   About the Company: BMXG  Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp., Inc. (OTC Pink Sheets: BMXG) is an  innovative biotechno|ogy R&D company, focused on the commercia|ization  of new  and groundbreaking stem cel| technologies.  The Company has focused its  initia| efforts on the |aunch of an innovative Adu|tCryogenic stem ce|l  bank which wi|l store stem ce|l tissues for use in treatment of future  diseases and ai|ments.  The Company p|ans to |aunch its initial  cryogenic stem ce|| facilities in mid-20O5, and is additiona|ly  exp|oring  opportunities for commercialization of new technologies in tissue  management, stem ce|l research instrumentation, and bio-systems  monitoring.   With impending establishment of an AdultStem cel| cryobank, research  efforts at the forefront of the stem ce|l market, and experienced  management  team, we expect Bio-Matrix Scientific Grp. to emerge as the newest and  most dynamic p|ayer in the explosive stem ce|l research market.   Investment Highlights:  BMXG is exceptionally we|| positioned at the forefront of one of the  most exciting new frontiers in biotech- stem cel| research.  Whi|e stem  ce|| therapy is still a new concept, expectations are high with  research  firm visiongain estimating that stem cell product revenues wi|l exceed  10 bil|ion by 2O13.  Recent|y, Ca|ifornia voters approved Proposition  71, a landmark piece of legis|ation that provides 3 bi|lion in stem  cel|  funding over the next decade.  With its initial focus on the establishment of stem ce|l cryogenic stem  ce|| storage faci|ities, BMXG is well situated in a growing and  commercia|ly successful market.  There are more than 10 major cord  b|ood banks  in the world, preserving ce|ls from more than 35,0OO donors.  Viacel|  has estimated that this market is 1.2 billion in the US and over 2  bi||ion wor|dwide.  As the pub|ic understanding of stem ce|| benefits  improves, we expect this niche market to enjoy exponential growth.  As  the  foremost stem cel| banker focused on the storage of Adu|tStem-cel|  growth  BMXG is a trendsetter in this market.  BMXG is making aggressive entry into the stem cell instrumentation  market with deve|opment of new medical devices specifical|y designed to  facilitate the removal and transp|ant of stem ce||s.  The Company is in  the process of securing patent protection for its inte||ectua|  properties, and we expect this to prove a major growth catalyst for  BMXG going  forward.  The Company benefits from a surprisingly strong (for a Pink Sheets  Company) and experienced management team, who have combined financial  acumen with scientific savvy to present a unique and promising mode|  for  growth in the stem ce|l market.  The Company's senior management team,  he|med by David Koos, PhD, has extensive experience in capita|  financing  and public company management, while its research efforts under Dr.  Phi|ip Watts (PhD- Ca|tech) are involved in the newest academic  research  into stem ce|l.   Investment Conclusion: Projected Va|uation: 3.5O per share  Wa|l Street has been quick to the react to the potential of stem cel|  research and stem cell stocks are outperforming a|l of the major  biotech  indices.  Leading stem cel| research companies such as StemCe|ls, Inc.  (STEM), Aastrom Biosciences (ASTR), and Cryo-Ce|| (CCEL) have witnessed  average 52 week share price appreciation of over 23O%! With its  enviab|e position in stem cel| research, strong management team, and  cryobank  operations, we think BMXG has the potential to demonstrate this type of  performance over the coming year, and urge you to consider adding BMXG  to your portfo|io today.

legitimate,phishing,True,"RE: Forecast for MGT Let me give you my thoughts. We acquired MGT on April 30.  If you include O&M expenses prior to that period of time you will be including all of the MGT salaries, allocations and overheads for which we had no responsibility. El Paso, through the transition services agreement, is performing the accounting functions for MGT.  Each month someone in my department provides to them actual expenses paid through Enron that need to be recorded as O&M on MGT.  These are additive to those expenses processed through the El Paso system.   I believe you should be picking up actuals from May 1 forward.   -----Original Message----- From: 	Concklin, Elaine   Sent:	Thursday, November 08, 2001 2:34 PM To:	Wiederholt, Patricia; Geaccone, Tracy Cc:	Phan, Kim; Ruckle, Jason; Zabawa, Mike; Perchal, Cheryl; Smilenova, Rositza; Clements, David; Weitekamp, James Subject:	Forecast for MGT  At Third Current Estimate, we added a full year forecast for MGT for Operations and added the MGT and Border amounts together on the Border page in the ETS Functional Income Statement as instructed.  We are trying to confirm what we should be reflecting.  Jason is being instructed that ETS should not pick up any actuals for January through May, and that we should use Actuals received from El Paso for June forward, and not our numbers.  The El Paso amounts for June through September are close to what we have, but not exact.  Please advise us as to what we should be reflecting and we will revise our schedules.  We did not pick up MGT at all until 3rd CE, so I'm OK with restating 3rd CE to reflect the appropriate amounts for MGT and rolling forward from there.

phishing,legitimate,True,"GOOD DAY CONFIDENTIAL/URGENT BUSINESS PROPOSAL. Dear Friend,  I am delighted to write this letter to you hoping that you will understand my predicament and answer back without hesitation.  I am Dr Maryam Abacha the wife of the late Nigerian head of State General Sani Abacha. I got your contact on the internet as I was making contact for a honest foreigner who will help save my life and my children, hence our country has been frustrating us since the death of my husband.  I am in possession of $25 000.000 (TWENTY FIVE MILLION U.S DOLLARS ONLY) which I want to invest in your country. For your clarification and understanding,this money in a box which my husband deposited in the finance and security company in dis-guise as a family treasure since 11th of febuary 1998, is not an ill gotten wealth rather, it was generated from my organisation FAMILY SUPPORT PROGRAM (F.S.P). I will enlighten you more of this organisation if you indicate a helping interest to secure this money on my behalf.  On your acceptance to render this assistance to me,I will instruct the finance company to effect a change of ownership of this fund in your name as the bona-fide owner to enable you claim the fund from the security and finance company,also I will disclose to you the country and the name of the finance and security company where this money is being deposited.  What I demand from you now is to arrange for a visit to the finance company where this money is being deposited and claim it as the bona-fide owner.It is very ideal you forward to me your private telephone and fax numbers to enable me send all relevant documents pertaining the deposit of this fund for your clarification and more understanding.  Bear in mind that this transaction demands absolute confidentiality because properties and bank accounts both local and international bearing the Abacha's family name, are being ordered to be confiscated by the newly elected civilian President of Nigeria (President Olusegun Obasanjo) hence I will not want to be exposed.  Let me refer you to the front page of This Day Newspapers of 10th March 2001. You can check it through their website:www.thisdayonline.com , click on archives,8th.june,2001) The present government in Nigeria had frozen and seized all my bank accounts both here in Nigeria and abroad.  Thus l shall expect you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss in detail about this transaction For your knowledge, 25% of this fund $25 000.000 (TWENTY FIVE MILLION U.S DOLLARS) will be given to you if you assist me to secure this fund and another 5% has been set aside for all the expenses you might incure during the process of securing this fund.Example: TELEPHONE BILLS, HOTEL BILLS, FLIGHT BILLS and other mislenous expenses.  When you must have taken the agreed percentage, you will use part of the balance to buy a living house for my family there in your country, where we shall live in the future and the remaining part will be kept for investment package also in your country which will be under your supervision.  Contact me through my son (OMAR ABACHA) who recently escaped from Nigeria to Johannesboug South Africa where he is now staying as a refuge on his email address omarabacha@hotmail.com to avoid us losing this money, since it is the only remaining fund for the survival of my family.

legitimate,phishing,True,"RE: Redfield Deliverability Project I would appear to me that there may be some misconceptions here.     Why do we assume that by entering into a financing deal we will be any better off?  I would tell you that to the extent there was any risk in the deal, that we should probably charge someone else about 25-30% as well.     Think about it, 25% is only 15% after tax.   Has some one enumerated the risks and valued them on this deal?   I haven't seen any of that work, if it has been done.           I think I understand the concept proposed and I understand the proposed goal line, return with little or no expense up front.     I would assume that we would be willing to enter into a fixed price service agreement for a number of years?     Is Halliburton willing to take any risks whatsoever?  Alternatively, why don't we go through GSS (Global Strategic Sourcing) to look for a better deal?	  Jim:   Have you looked at this for ideas on the accounting side?    Why can't I do a prepayment of a service contract fee and recognize the expense over the life of the deal?   -----Original Message----- From: 	Waymire, Dave   Sent:	Wednesday, October 17, 2001 9:17 AM To:	Hayslett, Rod; Gilbert, Steve Cc:	Centilli, James Subject:	RE: Redfield Deliverability Project  Rod,  Below is some background on the Redfield Deliverability Project.  Halliburton initiated the contact with NNG to provide work over on selected wells based on software modeling in order to return deliverability to their original levels.  The work overs are planned over a 2-3 year period and are expected to have a lasting effect of at least 10 years.  The cost to model and rework these wells is estimated to be $5.73MM.  A test program would be conducted in the first year to determine the feasibility of continuing the program at a cost of $768,000.  If the test program did not prove out the project would be terminated at this point.  The original proposal was to treat the costs of the program as expense as the costs were incurred. Bob Chandler confirmed this accounting treatment.  This would result as Kent has indicated negative EBIT for the first 2-3 years.   As an alternative it was proposed to Halliburton that NNG would enter into a 10 year service agreement with Halliburton to model and rework the wells and provide guidance on proposed well work overs for the Redfield storage field.  Halliburton would agree to perform the test program and if test results indicate that further work overs would be economically feasible would spend an additional $4.96MM on a total of 60 well workovers in the first 3 years of the contract.  NNG currently budgets $300,000 per year for Redfield well maintenance with minimal increase in deliverability. Operations has committed $300,000 per year in well maintenance over the next 5 years to this project for a total of $1.5MM.  Halliburton has not formalized their counter offer, but has indicated that they would require a 25% to 30% return for assuming the financing.  Halliburton indicated that this is a non-standard deal for them and that is the reason for high return requirement.    The objective is to structure the deal as a service agreement either with an Enron Entity who would then contract with Halliburton or some other third party at a more reasonable rate.  Even at an estimated 30% return, preliminary incremental EBIT estimates for the Halliburton service agreement are between $400,000 to $500,000 the first 5 years and  $250,00 to $275,000 for the out years.       -----Original Message----- From: 	Hayslett, Rod   Sent:	Friday, October 12, 2001 7:05 AM To:	Gilbert, Steve Cc:	Waymire, Dave Subject:	RE: Redfield Deliverability Project  Couple of quick comments.    Prepaying as an expense would require coming up with some income to offset, and generally doesn't make economic sense.   An Enron company can't help because it consolidates, and therefore ends up with the same accounting results as we do.       What accountants have reviewed the proposal?   -----Original Message----- From: 	Miller, Kent   Sent:	Thursday, October 11, 2001 9:52 AM To:	Hayslett, Rod; McCarty, Danny Cc:	Waymire, Dave; Neubauer, Dave; Neville, Sue; Thomas, Steve Subject:	Redfield Deliverability Project  Rod,  We looking for your help on some ideas on how to implement a good long term project that has negative short term cash flow.  We have been working with Halliburton to identify deliverability improvements at Redfield through the use of  improved technology related to identifying poor performing wells and implementing down hole remediation.  This project has costs and revenues as shown below that are great from a long term standpoint.  Steve Thomas and Maurice Gilbert have done an excellent job of identifying the benefits to NNG and the upsides in revenue that are expected.  Dave Waymire has also been very helpful in analyzing alternative and economics and have shown that the project has a great return (in excess of 30%).  Our problem is that the cost for the workovers at Redfield are all O&M expenses and not capital and we have a negative IBIT for the first 2 - 3 years of the project.  We have proposed that Halliburton structure the expenses such that they come in over a 5 - 10 year period so we don't have this negative IBIT flow in the first years, however, Halliburton has not been interested and has proposed a 30% finance charge for this structure.  What would be the appetite for possibly pre-paying a majority of these costs in '01 to avoid the negative '02 and '03 earnings impact or is there an Enron company that would finance/extend the expense payments.  This is a great project that we should do, however, it is difficult given the negative earnings impacts in the first couple of years.  Got any ideas to handle this financial hurdle??????

legitimate,phishing,True,"Victory!  Progressives defeat a right-wing Dem in Congress Dear MoveOn member,  We've been working together for years to make sure Democrats hold to progressive values and stand up to President Bush. It hasn't always been easy. But yesterday, something amazing happened.  In what the Washington Post called a ""stunning victory,""1 progressive underdog Donna Edwards triumphed in her primary against right-wing Democrat Al Wynn. That's one more vote for ending the war, for affordable health care, for ending global warming. And thousands of MoveOn members pitched in time, money, and shoe leather to make it possible.  It's a big deal, because it's not just about this race--it's about reminding the rest of the Democrats in Congress that at the end of the day, the voters call the shots.  We need to build on this success--to keep putting pressure on Democrats who have lost sight of progressive values, even as we gear up to win the White House in the fall.  Our plan is to use grassroots tactics, advertising, and yes, more primary elections. We'll do it hand-in-hand with our partners at the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and Working for Us PAC.  Can you donate $100 to support a major campaign to hold Democrats accountable? Click here:  https://pol.moveon.org/donate/democratsaccountable.html?id=12121-4776693-O.m6e2&t=260  In 2006, we helped Democrats take back Congress from the Republicans. And while many Democrats have stood up against the war and corporate interests, some have folded.  Holding those people accountable is what we're about. In some cases, sending a clear message to Democrats may be as simple as flooding their offices with calls, or running ads in their district on a key issue. In other cases, getting involved in primary elections is one of the best ways to hold them accountable. In those cases, we'll look for more strong progressive challengers like Donna Edwards, and if there is no challenger in the district, we might help recruit one.  MoveOn members joined with union members and other progressives--including, ACORN, Democracy for America, EMILY's List, the League of Conservation Voters, Progressive Maryland, SEIU, Sierra Cub, United Food and Commercial Workers, Women's Voices, Women's Votes, and more--to help put it over the top for Donna Edwards.  Together we ran ads to educate voters, contributed thousands to Donna's campaign, and hit the streets to turn out voters.  A few months back, we surveyed MoveOn members about Democratic accountability and over 78% said this should be a major priority for the year. Donna Edwards' victory is proof that Democrats in Congress who vote like Republicans can be defeated.  Working with SEIU and Working for Us PAC, MoveOn members can help fight for a majority that's not just Democratic, but progressive.  Can you chip in $100 to support our campaign to make it happen now?  https://pol.moveon.org/donate/democratsaccountable.html?id=12121-4776693-O.m6e2&t=261  Thank you.  --Adam, Eli, Daniel, Joan, and the MoveOn.org Political Action Team   Wednesday, February 13th, 2008  1.

phishing,legitimate,True,"for assistant Dear Sir, I am Alhaji Mohammed Abacha, the son of the late Nigerian Head of State who died on the 8th of June 1998 while in active services. Following the sudden death of my father, General Sani Abacha, the present Civilian Government has thrown my family and I into a state of utter confusion,  frustration,and hopelessness.  I have been subjected to inhuman physical and physiological torture, incarceration by the security Agents in my country. I was only recently released from detention after been arraigned before the Federal High Court of Nigeria for an offence committed by my late father. The incumbent civilian administration of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo has intensified his probe into my late father's activities while in the office and he has frozen all our local and foreign accounts together with  other assets of my family as a retaliation for what my late father did to him when he was alive as the Head of the Military regime in Nigeria.  As a matter of fact, we have been declared bankrupt and they are not relenting to make us poor for life.As a man that is so traumatized, I have lost confidence with anybody within my country as all those who benefited immensely during the regime of my late father have openly abandoned all my family.   MY REASONS FOR CONTACTING YOU. I got your contacts through my personal research and out of desperation decided to reach you through this medium.   You must have heard over the media reports and the Internet on the recovery of various huge sums of money deposited by my late father in different Banks and security firms abroad.  Some of these banks and security firms willingly gave-up/divulge their banking secrets and disclosed to the present civilian administration of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, all my family's cash lodgement and monetary transactions with them.Please my dear, I repose great confidence in you and I hope you will not betray my confidence in you.   I have secretly deposited the sum of $20,000,000.00 with a security firm abroad whose name is withheld for now until we open communications. The money is contained in a metal box consignment with Security Deposit Number.I shall be grateful if you could receive this fund into your Bank account for safekeeping.  This arrangement is known to you and my junior brother (Abbas) only. So I will deal directly with you. I am proposing a 20% share of the fund to you for your kind assistance. I shall provide for you all the documents of the fund deposit with the security firm, and raise a power of attorney `to enable you claim and receive this fund into your bank account. Also this transaction demands absolute disclose it to anybody  irrespective of your relation with the person.  Remember, loose lips sinks ship I am looking forward to your urgent and positive response via my email =. abacha2@webmail.co.za.  Best regards Alhaji Mohammed Abacha.",1

phishing,legitimate,True,"From: Mr.Al-Zarqawi Yusuf  From: Mr.Al-Zarqawi Yusuf  Dear Friend,  Your first reaction to this mail will be total rejection, scare and maybe disbelief, owning largely to the atrocities people commit these days.But this mail comes from a devastated, sorrowful and emotional laden soul that needs compassion from a kind and good spirited person to wipe away my tears and appropriate my dream and humanitarian gesture.  As you read this, I don't want you to  feel sorry for me, because, I believe everyone dies someday.,I am Al-Zarqawi Yusuf, A Oil merchant in Dubai, United Arab Emirate ( UAE). I have been diagnosed with Cancer, which was discovered very late, due to my laxity in caring for my health. It has defiled all forms of medicine; Right now I have only about a limited to live, according to my Medical Doctor. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for myself but the Oil business.Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.  I believe when Allah  gives me a second chance and  heal me I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it.I have sowed a seed for my healing I have willed and given most of my properties and assets to my immediate and extended family members and as well as a few close friends. i want Allah to be merciful to me and accept my soul and so, I have decided to give arms to charity organizations and give succor and comfort to the less privileged of the Tsunami and Hurricane Katrina Victims, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth so far, by distributed some of this money to some charity organizations in India,Hurricane Katrina victims in USA and other part of the world. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self anymore.I once asked members of my family  to close one of my accounts in Saudi Bank and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization and to the less  privileged in Bulgaria and Sudan.  They cashed the money but kept it only to themselves.  Hence I do not trust them anymore,as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them already.The last of my money, which no one knows of, is the huge cash deposit of Thirty Five Million United States Dollars ( US$35Million)  that I have in the Vault of The Security Company as family valuable since the year 2003 for safekeeping.I want you to collect this deposit on my behalf and disburse it to the Tsunami Earthquake victims in Asia for the less privileged. Please send me a mail to indicate your wiliness to assist in this disbursement.   I will set aside 10% for you for your time and efforts by notifying the security company as soon as i hear from you.I need your urgent reply with your full name and address, your Phone and Fax numbers and your Occupation so that I will not have to go on sourcing for a credible person to handle this project for himself and the rest of the less privileged.I will also plead to you to always pray for me because only Allah heals.   Wasaalam  Regards, Al-Zarqawi Yusuf.",1

My name is Mr. Melvin Samson I work as an accountant in a bank; I contacted  you to work together with me in claiming my late client's estate.  Unfortunately he died without a registered next of kin and as such the funds  now have an open beneficiary status. You could be made the beneficiary since  you share the same last name with him.  This has officially transferred the right to you, as no other person from  his family knows anything about this fund with our bank.If you are  interested in working with me,  please get back to me as quickly as possible so that I give you the details  of what we are to  do. I wait for your prompt response so that I can give  you more briefing of what you need to and how to do it.  Thanks for your co-operation.

This is techno|ogy which uses tiny sensors  to  transmit information about a person or object wire|essly.  * VNBL is a|ready an industry pioneer in the RFID Personal Location  Techno|ogy.  * VNBL is deve|oping a form of RFID techno|ogy which al|ows companies  and  governments to wire|essly track their assets and resources.  Such  techno|ogy  has HUGE potentia| in the protection and transportation of materials  designated ""High Risk"" were they to fal| into the wrong hands.  * VNBL works on integration of the two afore mentioned systems in order  to  create ""High Security Space"" in locales where it is deemed necessary.   Locations which may take advantage of such systems are airports, sea  ports,  mines, nuc|ear facilities, and more.  * As with a|l stocks, news drives the short term price. Fresh news has  made  VNBL a hot buy.   NEWS ON VNBL   MALIBU, Ca|if.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 16, 2O05--Vinob|e, Inc.  (OTCBB:VNBL -  News), a holding company seeking to identify |ong-term growth  opportunities  in the areas of homeland security, security information systems, and  other  security services, announced today that it plans to offer products and  services that wi|| assist in the automation of the identification and  contro| of equipment, assets, too|s, and the re|ated processes used in  the  Oil & Gas and Petrochemical industries.  Although smal| wireless|y networked RFID sensors can monitor machines  and  equipment to detect possib|e prob|ems before they become serious, they  can  also de|iver safety features within oil we|ls. Oil maybe trapped in  different layers of rock, a|ong with gas and water. Detection of  specific  liquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise  opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur,  such as  a we|l filling with water.  As with other RF based techno|ogy applications, RFID can a|so provide  the  safe transit of materia|s by on|y the authorized handler, and limit the  entry of personne| to specific |ocations. Ensuring personnel safety is  essential, shou|d there be an emergency at a faci|ity, RFID tags would  enab|e the customer to track and evaluate its employee's safety and/or  danger. This app|ication technology requires product and hardware that  can  operate in harsh and potential|y hazardous conditions, but gives  valuable  safety to the resources and assets that are vital to the customer. RFID  can  a|so assist the customer's supp|y chain by tracking oi|, gas, and  chemica|  products from extraction to refining to the sale at the retail level.  Vinob|e's viewpoint as previously stated is that these applications are  more  than just a va|uable tool to the mining industry, but as a protective  measure of our country's natura| resources and commodities against  threat.  Preservation of these fuels and resources is important to the safety of  U.S.  industry and economy.  The Company believes that such offering service and technology  application  in the Oil & Gas and Petrochemica| industry wi|| further position  Vinob|e in  a rapid|y expanding industry whi|e taking advantage of access to the  increasing capital and global spending that the Company will require  for  growth. The Company's goa| is to a|so provide a much-needed service at  a  cost manageable to even the sma|lest of businesses that can't afford to  do  without the safety of its personne| and assets in this current state of  constant threat.   This is Outstanding news.  The growth potentia| for this company is  exceptiona|.  In an already hot industry, VNBL.OB stands out as a truly  innovative pioneer.

AUSTRALIA ADDS TO MIGRATION OCCUPATIONS IN DEMAND LIST  09 May 2005 ________________________________________________________________________________________________________   On 8 May Australian Government announced changes to its immigration strategy by adding to its Migration Occupations in Demand List (MODL). The changes affect skilled visas for immigration to Australia.  The MODL and Skills Occupation List (SOL) form part of the backbone of Australia's point-based skilled migration strategy. Applicants under the points tested General Skilled Migration program for Australia who nominate an occupation on the MODL are awarded 15 points.   The following occupations were added to the MODL on 4 May 2005:  PROFESSIONAL: Civil Engineer  Dentist  Nuclear Medicine Technologist  Podiatrist  Speech Pathologist  TRADES: Bricklayer  Cabinetmaker  Carpenter & Joiner  Cook  Electrical Powerline Tradesperson  Electrician (Special Class)  Electronic Equipment Tradesperson  Fibrous Plasterer  General Electrician  General Electronic Instruments Tradesperson  General Plumber  Solid Plaster  OTHER OCCUPATIONS WHICH ARE IN THE EXISTING MODL ARE: Accountants  Chef  Hairdresser  Medical Practitioner  Physiotherapist  Registered Nurse    Immigration to Australia is especially for skilled people who wish to emigrate to a Country with a great lifestyle and excellent job opportunities. Unemployment is at an all-time low of 5.1%, the lowest in the last 25 years.  You do not need to relocate immediately after your application for permanent residence is approved. Normally, you can wait for 3 years from date of approval to relocate. Furthermore, the application and approval process can take a long time, usually more than a year.  We look forward to a meeting to discuss your needs.

IN FACT I COULD HAVE DONE THIS DEAL ALONE BUT BECAUSE OF MY POSITION IN THIS COUNTRY AS A CIVIL SERVANT(A BANKER),WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO OPERATE A FOREIGN ACCOUNT AND WOULD EVENTUALLY RAISE AN EYE BROW ON MY SIDE DURING THE TIME OF TRANSFER BECAUSE I WORK IN THIS BANK.

legitimate,phishing,True,"re : transitional assignments all i have received a few notes about this since this one but i will try to respond to all questions here . please see below responses in red : enron capital sally - husband and 3 children - ages 15 , 11 and 2 ) . i understand that the houses which have been vacated due to returning expats have all been filled , so can you have someone arrange for corporate housing that will accommodate them ? i think the best way to go here is for us to use serviced apartments as it will be very difficult to find a lease for such a short period for this type of accommodation . my assistant , lisa , has put a call in to a service who can help us find serviced accommodation in south kensington / chelsea area or in dolphin square where we have people now who are very satisfied . is there a reason you are partial to south kensington / chelsea ? what if we find accommodation in another nice area of london within a short commute to the office ? when i have some options , i will let you know , probably on monday . immigration - due to the fact that they will be traveling back and forth and have made trips already , i feel it would be best to apply for work permits versus using the visa waiver . i have sent them the forms and requested that brent complete his and file immediately to increase chances of getting his sometime shortly after he arrives in the uk . i have informed him that he should arrive without his family if the permit has not been received by april 1 . brent ' s work permit will be submitted today and we may receive if before april lst , but it is unlikely . the way it works for this is as follows : brent will receive the work permit from us and if he is here , he will have to leave the uk and enter with the work permit for it to be validated . if his family are in houston , they will need to receive entry clearance in the us prior to arriving in the uk . this takes approx 7 working days and they will require either brent ' s original passport and work permit or a certified copy of each along with other things such as marriage and birth certificates . if brent decides to bring his family with him to london prior to receiving the work permit , they must say they are coming on a vacation for a short period of time and have a return ticket to back it up . once the permit is received , the family can either travel back to houston and submit the entry clearance visas there or they can all travel to amsterdam where they are currenlty issuing entry clearance without a problem . there is always a small element of risk in going to amsterdam , however , as do not have to issue the stamps there , they just do it because they are nice ! work permits are arriving approx 4 weeks from date of submission . we can discuss all of this on the 20 th . tax - please confirm whether paye will need to be paid for them during the short term assignment and then reclaimed through a treaty benefit . paye is due after 60 days ; however , if brent and sally are really only going to be here for approx 75 days , i am not going to inform the revenue that they are here . if this extends beyond the set time , we can look at options but the only responsiblility that brent and sally will have is to ensure they complete the tax organiser in order for us to get the tax back . also , as we would have to apply the treaty here , we need to ensure the salary costs stay in houston . jane , have you discussed this point ? benefits - i have suggested that they remain on us domestic payroll and benefits and , if medical claims arise that exceed what they would have spent in the us , they may claim the excess on the expense report . agreed . per diem - we need to discuss the appropriate amount based on family size . jane , please call me to discuss . i have left you a message , thanks let me know of any other issues we need to address . as always , i appreciate your help . jane",0
legitimate,phishing,True,"Victory!  Progressives defeat a right-wing Dem in Congress Dear MoveOn member,  We've been working together for years to make sure Democrats hold to progressive values and stand up to President Bush. It hasn't always been easy. But yesterday, something amazing happened.  In what the Washington Post called a ""stunning victory,""1 progressive underdog Donna Edwards triumphed in her primary against right-wing Democrat Al Wynn. That's one more vote for ending the war, for affordable health care, for ending global warming. And thousands of MoveOn members pitched in time, money, and shoe leather to make it possible.  It's a big deal, because it's not just about this race--it's about reminding the rest of the Democrats in Congress that at the end of the day, the voters call the shots.  We need to build on this success--to keep putting pressure on Democrats who have lost sight of progressive values, even as we gear up to win the White House in the fall.  Our plan is to use grassroots tactics, advertising, and yes, more primary elections. We'll do it hand-in-hand with our partners at the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and Working for Us PAC.  Can you donate $100 to support a major campaign to hold Democrats accountable? Click here:  https://pol.moveon.org/donate/democratsaccountable.html?id=12121-4776693-O.m6e2&t=260  In 2006, we helped Democrats take back Congress from the Republicans. And while many Democrats have stood up against the war and corporate interests, some have folded.  Holding those people accountable is what we're about. In some cases, sending a clear message to Democrats may be as simple as flooding their offices with calls, or running ads in their district on a key issue. In other cases, getting involved in primary elections is one of the best ways to hold them accountable. In those cases, we'll look for more strong progressive challengers like Donna Edwards, and if there is no challenger in the district, we might help recruit one.  MoveOn members joined with union members and other progressives--including, ACORN, Democracy for America, EMILY's List, the League of Conservation Voters, Progressive Maryland, SEIU, Sierra Cub, United Food and Commercial Workers, Women's Voices, Women's Votes, and more--to help put it over the top for Donna Edwards.  Together we ran ads to educate voters, contributed thousands to Donna's campaign, and hit the streets to turn out voters.  A few months back, we surveyed MoveOn members about Democratic accountability and over 78% said this should be a major priority for the year. Donna Edwards' victory is proof that Democrats in Congress who vote like Republicans can be defeated.  Working with SEIU and Working for Us PAC, MoveOn members can help fight for a majority that's not just Democratic, but progressive.  Can you chip in $100 to support our campaign to make it happen now?  https://pol.moveon.org/donate/democratsaccountable.html?id=12121-4776693-O.m6e2&t=261  Thank you.  --Adam, Eli, Daniel, Joan, and the MoveOn.org Political Action Team   Wednesday, February 13th, 2008  1.

phishing,legitimate,True,"URGENT ASSISTANCE PARAMOUNT SECURITY COMPANY HOLLAND, LAGOS BRANCH. Private Email:{femimartins876@fsmail.net  Dear Friend, I am Mr.femimartins,Manager of paramount security company, Lagos Branch. I apologize for using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that your enviable credentials/particulars were given to me by a member of the South African Export Promotion Council who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as confidential because of the nature of this transaction . I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On Dec. 19, 1998, a Canadian Oil consultant/contractor with the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, Mr. Antoine Blanc made a numbered timed(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty Five Million Dollars)in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Ministry of Energy and Natural resources that Mr. Antoine Blanc died from a plane crash. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a Will, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was futile. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Antoine Blanc did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my security company. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my security company and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 6 (six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as an Foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Antoine Blanc so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of one Attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account either newly created or existing in any part of the world which you will provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 75% for me and 20% for you. Then 5% will be used to offset any expenses incurred during the entire processing. Please your percentage is not negotiable. it is considerate enough. There is no risk at all as the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney, and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.  If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email address below. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. I am awaiting your urgent reply via my email: .femi-martin876@fsmail.net  However, after your initial response by email, I would suggest that you contact me via phone 234 8055467101, for a verbal and detailed explanation of this transaction .This is imperative, because I would like to speak with you in order to be sure of who I would be with carrying out this transaction with.

I would appreciate comments from anyone, pro or > con, with knowledge and experience of these things, however, as I'm rather > limited on both.  I agree - it's never a good idea to use the same data for creating your classifier and determining it's effectiveness (I meant to say ""pick the one with the lowest error rate on your TEST data"").  The reason to choose from many random starts is that fitting a given neural network _model_ (ie. input x, n nodes, ...) is very hard due to the large overparameterisation of the problem space.  For example, the parameters for one node in a given layer can be exchanged with the parameters of another node (as well as the parameters that use those nodes in next layer), without changing the overall model.  This makes it very hard to optimise, and nnet in R often gets stuck in local minima. Looking at what individual nodes are doing, you often see examples where some nodes contribute nothing to the overall classification. The random starts aren't to find different models but to find the parameters for the given model that fits best.  And following this line of argument, you would probably want to use the internal criterion value, rather than some external measure of accuracy.  > The simple answer to the question of obtaining the error rate using > validation data is: Do whatever you like to choose/fit a classifier on the > training set. **Once you are done,** the estimate of your error rate is the > error rate you get on applying that classifier to the validation set.

You need yet new validation data for that.  Understanding that that estimate is biased is important, but in practice, do people really care that much?  If you have looked at a single plot of your data and used that to inform your choice of the classifier your estimates will already be biased (but if you have used other knowledge of the data or subject area, you might expect them to be biased in a positive direction). Are the estimates of model really the most important thing?  Surely an understanding of the problem/data is what you are really trying to gain.

Acquires Bil|iOn DO|lar Polymeta|lic  Inground Resource in Canadas Pro|ific Tombstone Go|d Belt, Yukon Territory  Press Release Source: Yukon Gold Corporation, Inc.  Toronto, Canada, March O7, 2005. Yukon Go|d Corporation, Inc. (Yukon  Go|d), (YGDC) announced today that it has acquired the Marg  Deposit, a 20,O0O acre, volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS)  property,  located in the centra| Yukon Territory.  Marg Deposit Mineral Resource Estimate:  Based on a 1997 ore resource study by Franzen Minera| Engineering Ltd.,  the Marg Deposit has a dri|l indicated resource of 6,1OO,0OO tons  grading 1.76% copper, 4.60% zinc, 2.46% lead, 62.7 g. of silver per ton  and  0.98 g. of go|d per ton over an average true width of 6.1 metres (20  ft.). Open a|ong strike in both directions and down dip, the Company  believes this c|assic base meta| deposit has the major potential for  substantia||y increasing tonnage.  At the end of the 1996 dri||ing  program,  the thickest and richest intersection, 16.2 metre (53 ft.) true width  averaged 2.82% copper, 2.46% lead, 5.5O% zinc, 82.5 g of si|ver and  1.84  g. of go|d per ton.  This indicates potentia| increased massive  su|phide thicknesses to the west. Based on current meta| prices, the  in-ground  va|ue of the Marg resource without any further exp|oration is just over  1 Bi||i0n d0|lars. (*)(**) A preliminary evaluation by Yukon Golds  engineers  and geologists have determined this outcropping deposit with its  favorab|e topography, resource base and excel|ent exploration  potentia|, will  warrant proceeding to production.  (*) Dollar Figure in Canadian (**)Tota| in-ground resources and current va|ues based on US Copper   $1.50 lb, Lead  $0.45 lb, Zinc  $0.62 |b, Silver  $7.29 oz., Go|d   $432.OO oz. as  of February 23, 2005, Exchange rate O.8O.

They also said most of that is now coming from Europe. That's a change from previous reports that had suggested servers in North America were responsible. What the Symantec report doesn't explicitly state is that much of the European spam doesn't come from individuals sitting at their desk pumping out lists. Europe is one of the hotbeds for the Storm worm botnet, notorious for automatically co-opting its victims into spam relays. For example, with the release of a Valentine's Day theme-spam barrage in early February,  Jose Nazario of Arbor Networks estimated that Storm has grown by as much as 50 percent in new infections. More ominous, Nazario says ""the fact (Storm) is generating lots of money means that it's in (the creator's) interests to keep grooming it, keep growing it."" Worse Storm isn't the only big, bad botnet in town. Read more Security Bites podcast CNET Security Center Security Watch archive   Robert VamosiCNET.com       Latest forum discussions  What is...

I am  Richard Akintunde, the Secretary/Legal Adviser of the Zambia Overseas Task Force on Foreign Payments.

All the Contracts (Foreign and Indigenous) awarded under the tenure of Chiluba are being reviewed now, as there were many bogus claims. However, some claims are legitimate.

The company just bottomed at $O.06 and we believe in the next 1 to 2  weeks this stock will go back to at least $O.4O                    C O M P A N Y   O V E R V I E W   Vinoble, Inc. (VNBL.OB) is a holding company, which is identifying and  acquiring operational business opportunities in the areas of homeland  security, security information systems, and other security services to  provide long term growth for its shareholders.  Vinoble believes that the opportunity to build a successful business in  the security sector is unprecedented.  The terror attacks on the United States on September 11, 20O1 have  changed the security landscape for the foreseeable future. Both  physical  and logical security have become paramount for all industry segments,  especially in the banking, healthcare and government sectors. While the  focus for Vinoble is on North America, the opportunity for security  services is worldwide. According to Giga, a wholly owned subsidiary of  Forrester Research, worldwide demand for information security products  and  services is set to eclipse $46B by 2O05.  Vinoble intends to capitalize on the dramatic growth in the security  market by delivering professional services, security products, security  training, and managed security services. In pursuit of this objective,  Vinoble has assembled a highly qualified team of security professionals  offering a full range of security services. Through Vinoble's  consulting services and integrated delivery solutions, Vinoble will  help  organizations protect key assets including persons, property,  information,  brand, and reputation.   Homeland Security, the National Strategy for a Secure Cyberspace, the  Healthcare Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA),  Sarbanes-Oxley and other regulatory programs will all cause a continued  increase in security demands in the United States and abroad. Vinoble  intends  to position itself as the 'most desired' provider of, both, physical  and information security solutions - in the eyes of our clients,  alliance  partners, and peers. We will accomplish this by ensuring our teams are  the most knowledgeable, agile, professional, and cost-conscious  provider of 'tailored' security solutions to meet the unique needs of  each  client.  Management has partnered with GarcyCo Capital Corp. (""GCCC"") to assist  in finding acquisition candidates for the company, structuring such  acquisitions, and effecting a transition to corporate growth. At  present,  Vinoble and GCCC have targeted several companies as potential  acquisition candidates. Pending the outcome of due diligence and  audits, the  company believes the acquisition of these assets will provide the basis  required for listing on a national exchange.    HERE IS RECENT NEWS ON THE COMPANY:  MALIBU, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 2O, 2O05--Vinoble, Inc. (OTCBB:  VNBL - News), a holding company seeking to identify long-term growth  opportunities in the areas of homeland security, security information  systems, and other security services, is pleased to announce that as it  continues in its efforts to reach definitive agreements on the acquisition  of assets, businesses, and strategic partners in the RFID and GPS  tracking sector, Vinoble has further engaged with several additional  businesses and individuals for the purpose of acquiring technology, software,  and patents.   Following the move to acquire RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)  technology, hardware and patents for the sole purpose of specific use  applications, the Company has concluded that the need for application  support software or middleware is part of the fundamental component of the  framework which operates such technology. The Company has identified  several sources for both licensing and the acquisition of such software,  and has begun to pursue discussions to access this important element.   Middleware is used primarily to link disparate applications, both  internally and externally, to the enterprise. This typically involves  routing data using different transport protocols, translating data into  different formats and providing a suitable means of integration such as Web  services and service-oriented architectures.   Since RFID is an integral part in the tracking of both mobile and  non-mobile assets, user-friendly and efficient management software enabling  customers to manage RFID data both incoming and out-bound is important  in maintaining customer loyalty and reduces costs associated with  customer service. Management software will allow for real time visibility of  assets or product inventory, whether in transit, in a warehouse, at the  manufacturing plant, or on a store shelf. Visibility and accuracy will  enable customers to reduce handling costs, gain instant access to  shipment information and increase inventory flow throughout the supply  chain. The ability to manage data collection from a number of different RFID  and GPS devices is essential for proper efficiency of the system.   The Company believes that such acquisition of middleware technology  will be essential and will further position Vinoble in the vastly growing  RFID and GPS tracking industry. The Company's goal is to provide  critical security services at a cost manageable to even the smallest of  businesses that can't afford to do without the safety of their personnel and  assets in this current state of constant threat.

But we don't really know exactly why Cho Seung-Hui went on a rampage on the campus of Virginia Tech. For our first story, correspondent Scott Pelley talks to Secret Service intelligence officers, whose exhaustive research into the minds of potential assassins and school shooters will provide valuable insights. Pelley is speaking with the officers today, April 20, and will report this story over the weekend, for what will perhaps be the freshest look yet at the mind of this mass killer.         This past week was also the deadliest in Baghdad - over 200 Iraqis were killed in a single day.  It has become a living hell for citizens of Baghdad just trying to get through an average day, as correspondent Lara Logan reports in our second story. How does one live in such a place? Very carefully, reports Logan, and often with the protection of a weapon, or in the case of Dr. Quoresh al-Kasir, the U.S. military. Nearly 200 doctors have been murdered in Iraq by insurgents intent on destroying Iraqi society. Soon after bullets began to crash through his windows, Dr. Quoresh heard a hopeful sound. ""We heard the helicopters starting to come to the area. My sons and daughter said, 'Oh, Baba, the Americans started to reach the area.'""     Watch  Logan's Reporter's Notebook.        The firing of Don Imus for uttering racially charged and misogynistic words black rap stars routinely use in their lyrics has shifted the spotlight to hip-hop culture and its dark messages.  As you'll see in our third piece, CNN's Anderson Cooper discovers that one of the rappers' popular messages, ""stop snitchin',"" does not help the police, but has actually confounded investigators' efforts to solve crimes, especially murder, and has now created some lawless neighborhoods.  Says Geoffrey Canada, educator and anti-violence advocate from New York City's Harlem neighborhood, ""It's like we're saying to the criminals, 'You can have our community....Do anything you want and we will either deal with it ourselves or we'll simply ignore it.'""

Also, there is a vicious rumour going round that a year or so ago a rather large company in the UK lost a court case where an employee sent out some kind of libellous email or somesuch despite the company having implemented email disclaimers. pay no heed to this - its just a rumour (http://www.weblaw.co.uk/artemail.htm).Anyway, please: Email exel.com!!!> kevinNB: This email is copyright 2002 Paul Jakma.

I am writting this letter with due respect and heartful of tears since we have not known or met ourselves previously, I am asking for whom to love and love me as well after I have gone through your profile and i just pick interest on you.   I am fair in complexion, I am about 5fit 7in tall, I love sport events, going outdoors activities, watching of moving, shopping, walking etc.In a nutshell, My name is Miss Fatoumata Saleeby 22 years old from the republic of Liberia in west Africa, now seeking for refugee in Dakar-Senegal under the (UNHCR).  I therefore write to inform you that I am the only surviving child and daughter of the deceased Dr. ELIE E. SALEEBY the former MINISTER OF FINANCE / EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CENTRAL BANK OF LIBERIA in the year July 1997-Feb. 2003.  The reason for this correspondence is to formally request for mutual assistance on business relationship with you in order to benefit from your wealth of experience in business.   The secret fact therefore, is that my father kept the sum of US$4,700, 000.00 (Four million seven hundred thousand US Dollars) CASH. The money was deposited at Bank here in Dakar Senegal.   The money is the share of proceeds from a deal executed with my father's colleagues in the hierarchy of membership of the LIBERIAN JOINT PUBLIC TENDER BOARD during a contract award to an Ukrainian - RUSSIA Diamond Extracting Company when my father was a chairman.   Due to the civil war caused by rebel leader Charles Taylor who has just been toppled by another rebel group and my father's status as a civil-servant by law in my country and the sensitivity of my father's position that attracts public attention, he cannot operate a Domiciliary account in order to keep this large sum of money in a bank in my country.   My father retired and died lately before he could withdraw this money here in and transfer it out of Africa. I anticipate to conclude arrangement to start this venture with you as quick as possible.   Due to my youthful age and also refugee here in senegal, decide to claim the money now with a foreign partner.   Upon your indicated interest, we will arrange for a meeting in the country of your choice when the money is moved from the Bank to your account and discuss in details the terms of agreement. I want to invest in any company that you suggest under your professional guidance. Please include your private mobile telephone number in your reply for easy communication.   I earnestly await your urgent response as I expect you to treat this matter with required maturity, attention and committment.   with best regards  Fatoumata Saleeby. v",1

EMAIL.steffanmuller@gmx.net  RESPOND THROUGH MY Alternative email address: steffanmuller@gmx.net  I am MR STEPHAN MULLER, credit officer of Citibank, Dsseldorf,Germany.I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. In June, 1999, a German property consultant and exporter of used cars ,Mr Andreas Schranner made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at DM30,000,000.00(Thirty Million Deutschmark only)which is now 18,000,000.00(Eighteen Million Euro)only in my branch. It was to our utter suprise that we heard of his death, wife and children in an AF4590 plane crash in July 2000. See website below:  On further investigation,I found out that he died without making a WILL, and hitherto, all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. Mr Andreas Schranner was residing at No 1 Rue de Avenida, G.R.A. ouagoudougou, burkina faso, West Africa. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr Andreas Schranner did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of 21,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Laws of Deutschland, at the expiration of 7(seven)years,the money will be declared frozen and forfeited to German Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin or business partner to Mr Andreas Schranner so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not be conficated by the German Government. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address,phone and fax numbers so that i can prepare the necessary documents that will put you in place as the next of kin or business partner. Your role in this transaction is to send an application for claim of the funds to our bank. Then, as top official of the bank, I shall work behind-the-scene to make sure that your application is approved by the management of the bank, and the funds transfered to your nominated bank account. Please note that there is no iota of risks at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done legitimately and with my position as top official of the bank i would ensure a successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately to my email box. Please send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication. You should observe utmost CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECRECY in this transaction, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I will require your assistance to invest my share in your country. I look forward to your prompt response. Thanks and regards. MR STEPHAN MULLER Alternative email address: steffanmuller@gmx.net",1

legitimate,phishing,True,"Cabot Wealth Advisiory 7/5/07 - TV, Intelligence and More July 5, 2007  Salem, Massachusetts  By Timothy Lutts  -----  There's Nothing On!  The SAT Measures What?  A Company With Predictive Decisioning Software  -----  My wife recently attended a conference in upstate New York and one night found herself back in her hotel room, turning to the television for entertainment.  Now, in our family, real-time network television is a rare event.    Thanks to Replay TV, a one-time competitor of TiVo in the DVR (digital video recorder) business, our favorite shows get recorded on a big hard disk and we watch them when we want, skipping the commercials as we go.  In fact, the only time we watch commercials is during the Super Bowl.  More often, we read.  In any event, there was my wife, in a New York state hotel room, ""forced"" to choose from a dreadful selection of real-time network TV offerings.  Of course she could have turned it off, but in that dull hotel room in that strange town, she was just searching for a little life, a little humor, a little intelligence.  What she got was bad TV, along with an onslaught of repetitive, often-insulting commercials.  So she called me, and somewhere along the way she asked, ""Why do people watch this garbage?  And why do the networks play the same commercials, sometimes several times during the same show?""  I couldn't give her an easy answer, but I did sympathize, and that's really what she wanted.  Soon after, I googled ""top ten TV shows,"" and here's what I found.  America's Got Talent Dateline NBC Deal or No Deal Law and Order N-C-I-S C-S-I Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader? Two and A Half Men So You Think You Can Dance? C-S-I Miami  I've never seen any of these, which goes to show you how out of touch I am.  But I do know (from reading) that four of them are crime dramas, two are talent searches, two are game shows, one is a sitcom and one is a news magazine that typically focuses on human-interest stories.  Reviewing this list, I'm reminded of the words of HL Mencken, who wrote, ""No one in this world, so far as I know, has ever lost money by underestimating the intelligence of the great masses of the plain people.""  Then, a few days ago one of my editors commented to me, no doubt after viewing one of the those headlines like ""Man Shoots Self in Groin While Attempting To Make Ham Sandwich,"" ""You know, half of Americans are of below average intelligence.""  Upon reflection, it's obvious.  And it's statistically inevitable.    The average is near the middle, so half will always be below the average (technically, below the median, but given the very large numbers we're dealing with, there's little difference.)  And if you don't know the difference between mean and median, you probably haven't crammed for an SAT test lately.  The converse, however, does not mean that if you do know the difference you have crammed for the test recently.  That's logic at work.  And the SAT, now that I've brought it up, is not what it used to be.  In 1901 it debuted as the Scholastic Achievement Test, supposedly measuring what students had learned.  In 1941, the name was changed to Scholastic Aptitude Test, supposedly measuring what students were capable of learning, if they had the proper socio-economic advantages.  In 1990, that was changed to Scholastic Assessment Test, supposedly measuring . . . something scholastic?  And in 1994 the name was changed to SAT (the letters officially standing for nothing at all!)  Finally (or, should I say, most recently, because I suspect there are more changes around the corner), in 2005 the name was changed to SAT Reasoning Test, creating a potential redundancy of the word ""Test"" but only if the first T still stood for Test, which it doesn't.  Reasoning, of course, includes logic, and I like that a lot. I hope they keep that name for a while.  Now, I took the SAT a few decades back.  Two of my kids have taken it and the third is likely to in a couple years.  But something else has changed over the decades besides the name.  In 1995 the yardstick for scoring was adjusted to account for the growing number of kids from less rigorous schools taking the test.  The reason?  The big bulge in the middle of the distribution curve, which had previously been centered at 400, had slipped down into the mid-300s.  To get the mid-point back up, the average verbal score was artificially increased by some 70 points while the average math score had 20-30 points added.  The kids at the top and bottom were barely affected, but the masses of average kids near the middle saw their scores bumped up dramatically.  What does it matter?  Well, a good score helps you get into college.    But is there a correlation between success on the SAT and success in college?  Looking further out, is there correlation between success on the SAT and success in life?  The simple answer is, some, but not a lot.  And more and more colleges are recognizing that; the number of colleges that admit students without regard to test scores now exceeds 400.  But the SAT lives on, and will continue to be here for years to come.  Why?  In part because it's the product of The College Board.    The College Board is a non-profit organization, and while there's no doubt that it works hard to serve the high schools and colleges and families that use it, there's even less doubt - in my mind - that the organization works even harder to ensure its own survival.   ----- ADVERTISEMENT -----  Join Cabot Stock of The Month and get in on the next stock that explodes like these...   * Broadvision-up 670%  * Intuitive Surgical-up 500%  * Yahoo-up 317%  * Amazon.com-up 1,290%  * First Marblehead-up 50%  * International Game Technology-up 110%  * eResearch Technology-up 180%  * NetEase-up 100%  * Expedia-up 114%  * Broadcom-up 97%  * Netflix-up 173%  * Psychiatric Solutions-up 85%  * PetroKazakhstan-up 86%  * Nautilus-up 109%  That's the beauty of Cabot Stock of the Month.

""A financial services firm in Japan has begun offering lower mortgage interest rates to ""intelligent"" customers.  GE Consumer Finance Company is giving discounts to people who have good English or computer skills, and work in ""high-value"" areas such as the law.  The company says more highly skilled workers usually find it easier than others to get jobs and to keep them. They are therefore less likely to become insolvent and default on their home loan.  GE Consumer Finance Company claims this is the first time that mortgage rates have been calculated like this in Japan.  People who have high scores on a test of English proficiency and officially certified IT skills can apply for a small discount.  Those of them who also have certain jobs - such as lawyers, accountants, doctors and financial experts - can obtain further discounts.  If a couple are both employed in the 20 ""high-value"" professions listed by the company, they will be entitled to a major rate reduction.""  It makes sense, and I'm guessing it's illegal to discriminate that way in the U.S.  -----  Getting back to TV, the problem is not just the quality of programming but the quantity of time people spend viewing.  The TV is on for over 7 hours in the average American home, and the average American watches over 4 hours of TV per day.  Worse still, the average American child watches 1,023 hours of TV a year and spends 900 hours in school.  And one thing they're seeing in those hours is commercials.  For broadcast TV, commercials pay the bills, and the advertisers are doing all they can to ensure that the message from those commercials reaches your brain.  But more and more these days, people are working to avoid those commercials by fast-forwarding through them using DVRs.  So NBC recently tested people to see if those commercials had any impact at high-speed.  NBC, you know, wants its advertisers' money even if viewers are watching at fast speeds.  The result, according to a story three days ago in The New York Times, ""judging from the biological reactions, the test subjects were just as engaged while watching fast-forwarded advertisements as they were while viewing opening scenes from the NBC show ""Heroes"" at regular speed.""  When it comes to fast-forward advertisements, ""the assumption has always been that they have no economic value, that they have no communication value,"" said Alan Wurtzel, president for research at NBC Universal. ""But the fact of the matter is we're learning that they are valuable.""  And they're so ""valuable"" to the financial health of the TV industry that the commercial-skipping DVR that I bought years ago can no longer be bought!  But the problem is not just the commercials.  The problem is that every minute spent watching TV is a minute not being used to reflect, to do something productive, or to interact with other family members.  And the result of all this TV viewing, according to a recent study by the Culture and Media Institute, is that ""increased exposure to television correlates with a decline in acceptance of personal responsibility.""  Now, it's important to note that the word correlate was used there.    Officially, there's no established causality.  But my sense is that our country has seen a marked decrease in a sense of personal responsibility; that too many people all too easily blame others for their troubles.  And when personal responsibility shrinks, we get a culture that thinks it's okay to act stupid because somebody else will pick up the tab.  ----- Contest -----  Now, there is an investment idea coming here, but first I want to give a reward to a loyal reader who has chosen to read this far.

It's about intelligence and it's about marketing, and if you understand how important marketing is to the world, you may like this one enough to invest in it.  You know and I know that at every turn, companies are doing their darndest to sell us things.  At Amazon they know what I've bought before and thus know what to sell me next.  And at Netflix they know what movies I've rated highly so they can suggest other movies they think I'd enjoy.  Those two firms have developed specialized software that serves their individual needs, but for most companies, there's off-the-shelf software that works very well, and a lot of it is coming from a company named Chordiant.  Here's what we wrote in a recent issue of Cabot Top Ten Report.  ""Chordiant (CHRD) makes customer service and marketing software that helps big companies deal with their customers, so that the goals of both the merchant and the customer are met. Customers include 21st Century Insurance, Bank of Ireland, Banque Populaire, Barclays, Capital One, Covad Communications, Cox Communications, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Lloyds, MetLife, Nokia, Prudential, Royal Bank of Scotland, Royal Dutch Shell, Time Warner Cable, T-Mobile, UPS and Wachovia. These are huge blue-chip companies, yet Chordiant is still a small company, and growing fast. Historically, the company has had trouble making a profit (its last profitable year was 2004), but after the first quarter's terrific results, CEO Steven R. Springsteel commented that solid profitability was ""due to the strong performance in our international business, the acceleration of percentage of completion project implementations in Europe, and greater enablement of our partners resulting in fewer Chordiant resources being required on some project implementations."" It sounds good to us. Since then the company has been awarded a patent for ""advanced predictive decisioning technology."" In other words, the companies using this software sometimes know what you're going to buy before you do! As companies come to depend on this software, Chordiant's future is likely to be consistently profitable, and the realization of that is why the stock is strong today.""  Digging deeper, I see that Chordiant has been growing revenues since 2003, and in the latest quarter saw revenues grow 25% from the year before to $32.8 million, while earnings jumped from a penny per share to $0.18 per share.  Analysts are projecting a profit of $0.48 per share this year and $0.72 per share next year.  And the after-tax profit margin was a fat 19.6%.  Trading at 16, it's rather low-priced and thus carries the extra risk of volatility that comes from stocks at this level.   But average trading volume is nearly 500,000 shares per day, and institutional interest is growing.  I'd like it better on a dip to 15, but if it doesn't dip there in the week ahead, 16 may be the best price you'll get.  -----  Editor's note:  To get regular updates on Chordiant, and to get first notice of other hot stocks, consider a no-risk trial subscription to Cabot Top Ten Report.

AB452 Cocody, Abidjan, Cote D`Ivoire Telefax: +225 07384968 E-mail: abrahamlegalfirm@rediffmail.com   Attn: The Director,   I am Abraham Umeh, a Solicitor at law and Corporate Attorney. I am the personal attorney to Late. Mr. Kenneth Berg a foreign national, who used to work as a contractor with Crystal Construction Company in Abidjan,Cote D`Ivore.   On the 21st of April 2000, my client, his wife and their three children were involved in a car accident along the auto route and all occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives. Since then I have made several enquiries both local and international to locate any of my clients relatives which has proved largely unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts to locate any member of his family for the past three years I decided to contact you.  I am contacting you to assist in transferring out the money left behind by my client to your country before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the bank where this huge deposit were lodged. Particularly the bank where the deceased had an account valued at 10 million United States dollars, they have issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the account confiscated within the next one month.   Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 3years now I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased so that the proceeds of this account valued at 10 million USD can be paid to you and then you and me can share the money 50% to me and 50% to you. I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim we may make like the Certificate of Deposit and Copy of Agreement issued to my client on the date of deposit, I also have a copy of the death Certificate of my client. All I require is your honest cooperation and maximum secrecy to enable us see this deal through.   I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Please get in touch with me through my email address above and repeated here  ( abrahamlegalfirm@rediffmail.com ) and send to me your personal telephone / fax numbers and email address to enable us discuss further about this transaction.

Iraqi insurgents joined 10,000 U.S. troops in the offensive and took control of several areas north of Baghdad today. David Martin will have the latest.     And our chief foreign correspondent Lara Logan will update us on the orphanage story she reported on Monday. She'll give us some encouraging news about how the once-neglected Baghdad orphans are doing now.      Back in the United States, a South Carolina community is beginning the process of mourning nine firefighters who died in massive furniture factory blaze. Tonight, Kelly Cobiella will share the story of one man who escaped from the inferno.      And there's extraordinary new animation that shows more clearly than we've seen before why the World Trade Center towers collapsed on 9/11 after being hit by airplanes.     What if a Web site could tell you that going to one hospital in your area rather than another could dramatically improve your odds of survival? Now, one has been set up by the U.S. government. Wyatt Andrews will give you all the details.     Finally, it's been 35 years since the Watergate scandal drove former President Richard Nixon out of office. Now historians at the National Archives are poring over his speeches, gifts and recordings - yes, even that 18  minutes of blank tape - for installation at the Nixon Library. Richard Schlesinger will take us inside the vault for a fascinating history lesson.

Introduction:  My name is Mr. Keykhosrow Sobhe and l am the Solicitor to Mr. Robert who died on a plane crash with his entire family on the 11th of September 2001 along side other passengers in flight 175. from Boston, Massachusetts to Los Angeles California, it was the second hijacked plane to strike the World. Trade Center plugging into the South Tower. Two pilots and seven flight attendants and fifty-seven(57) passengers were on board.  Since Mr. Roberts death, there has not been any application to claim his money by a next-of-kin as his wife who was supposed to be his next-of-kin died along side with my late client in the same accident. After 4 years of dormancy any such accounts holding funds of certain magnitudes will be re-directed to the bank treasury as unclaimed funds  and will be shared among the bank share holders. After which the file will  be closed. This is what I am trying to prevent from happening. I will rather see the whole money go directly to charity organization with a help of a foreigner.  If you share the same ideology as myself, please do not hesitate to contact me. However, it may interest you to know that we have secured from probate  and order of mandamus to locate any of the diseased surviving next-of-kin. upon this discovery.

All documentation will be carefully worked out by me for the funds to be released into your favor as the beneficiary's next-of-kin.  NOTE: THE REASON WHY I AM DOING THIS IS THAT, I WOULD RATHER SEE THE WHOLE AMOUNT GO DIRECTLY TO CHARITY, THAN HAVE THOSE BANK DIRECTORS AND SHARE HOLDERS HAVE IT IN THEIR PERSONAL BANK ACCOUNTS.  IT IS ALSO A LIFE TIME OPPORTUNITY FOR ME AND HOPEFULLY YOU AS WELL.

The paper is available on the Publications page of my website, www.EHirst.com << File: http://www.ehirst.com/ >> . Please let me know if you have any comments on the paper. Here is a summary of the paper:         California was supposed to show the rest of the nation a brighter electricity future. That future, as outlined by the California Public Utilities Commission in 1994, envisioned an electricity industry featuring competitive markets. Such markets were intended to produce lower costs and more choices for consumers, while ensuring profits for efficient energy suppliers and encouraging the retirement of old, inefficient power plants.         Although the first two years of restructuring (beginning in April 1998) seemed to bear out these promises, the last year has been a disaster for California's electricity consumers, taxpayers, and electric utilities. Part of the fallout from California's electricity crisis is considerable concern-even opposition-in other states to restructuring the electricity industry.          Although a few states have decided, based on the California experience, not to restructure, I believe that is the wrong outcome. Instead, the primary lessons other states should learn from California are that competitive markets can work; competition is not to blame for California's problems; and basic economic principles of supply, demand, and prices affect market outcomes.         Section 2 of this paper briefly reviews the history of electricity regulation and restructuring in California and the problems that occurred beginning in May 2000. Section 3, the heart of this paper, offers guidance to other states on the key ingredients of a competitive electricity industry. This section makes several points:   Maintain a favorable investment and regulatory climate for new generation to ensure that enough generation capacity is online and planned to meet growing loads.   Ensure that enough infrastructure (transmission capacity and natural gas pipeline capacity) is in place and planned to meet growing loads, maintain reliability, connect new generators to the grid, support large regional markets, and provide fuel to power plants.   Encourage retail customers to participate in dynamic-pricing and voluntary-load-reduction programs (i.e., couple retail and wholesale markets).   Create honest retail competition: avoid standard-offer rates with artificial discounts and create conditions that encourage many companies to offer retail services without favoring individual competitors.   Encourage electricity suppliers to manage and diversify their supply and price risks.   Create efficient and integrated wholesale markets for energy, ancillary services, and transmission congestion.   Monitor and minimize horizontal market power (generation) and vertical market power (combined ownership and operation of generation and transmission).           Ultimately, competitive markets for electricity will lower costs and prices, better align consumer prices with producer costs, improve producer efficiency in both investment and operation, maintain or improve reliability, and yield greater innovation in customer services and pricing options.          But, this transition from one industry structure to another is turning out to be long and complicated. It is complicated because electricity is so important to our modern, high-tech society; electricity is our most flexible fuel, providing light, heat, motive power, and the energy to operate all our electronic equipment. Also, electricity truly is a real-time product for which production and consumption must occur at the same time.          Although the problems that have occurred in California are substantial and worrisome, regulators and legislators in other states should focus on the long-term benefits of competitive electricity markets and accept the possible short-term problems that may occur. They also need to recognize that wholesale markets are regional in scope and extend far beyond the boundaries of any single state. Finally, competition in retail and wholesale markets must be coordinated; in particular, it is not possible to have competitive wholesale markets unless at least some retail load faces time varying prices.          If states restructure properly to create competitive markets for wholesale energy and retail services, we should all benefit. Consumers will enjoy lower prices, they will have many more choices of energy services and price-risk tradeoffs, reliability will be improved because most reliability services will be obtained through markets instead of by engineering edict, and the financial risks associated with building and operating power plants will be assigned properly to investors rather than consumers.

legitimate,phishing,True,"Why spam isn't going away soon    CNET | Security Center                March 3, 2008     View online | Manage newsletters | Unsubscribe | Send us feedback                Why spam isn't going away soon         Recently, Symantec said in its February 2008 State of Spam report that 78.5 percent of all e-mail is spam. They also said most of that is now coming from Europe. That's a change from previous reports that had suggested servers in North America were responsible. What the Symantec report doesn't explicitly state is that much of the European spam doesn't come from individuals sitting at their desk pumping out lists. Europe is one of the hotbeds for the Storm worm botnet, notorious for automatically co-opting its victims into spam relays. For example, with the release of a Valentine's Day theme-spam barrage in early February,  Jose Nazario of Arbor Networks estimated that Storm has grown by as much as 50 percent in new infections. More ominous, Nazario says ""the fact (Storm) is generating lots of money means that it's in (the creator's) interests to keep grooming it, keep growing it."" Worse Storm isn't the only big, bad botnet in town. Read more Security Bites podcast CNET Security Center Security Watch archive   Robert VamosiCNET.com       Latest forum discussions  What is...

legitimate,phishing,True,"reimbursement of individually billed items the use of cell phones and pagers has increased dramatically in the past few years . as a result the accounts payable department has seen a rapid increase in the number of invoices and vendors . with the higher volume , we have reviewed our processes in order to continue our rapid payment cycle . although we encourage vendors to address their invoices to individual employees , they often mail invoices directly to accounts payable . at times they fail to list the individual who uses the pager or cell phone . in these cases we return the invoice to the vendor . if the employee is designated , we try to track him / her down and forward the invoice . the high level of employee movement among jobs and locations at enron has made this increasingly challenging . either way , we end up doing something less productive than paying invoices . to maintain satisfactory response to our vendors and to reduce time necessary for research , we request that employees who have pagers , cell phones , and other individually billed items such as licenses , subscriptions , etc . , pay for them by personal check or charge card ( if applicable  * payment instructions are usually indicated on the invoice ) and request reimbursement through employee expense reports . by submitting these charges on your expense report , you can help us reduce the amount of time spent researching and forwarding invoices , the number of checks generated by treasury , the number of vendors in our database , and the turnaround time for payment of invoices .",0

legitimate,phishing,True,"[R] ANOVA non-sphericity test and corrections (eg,	Greenhouse-Geisser) I'm an experimental psychologist and when I run ANOVA analysis in SPSS, I normally ask for a test of non-sphericity (Box's M-test).  I also ask for output of the corrections for non-sphericity, such as Greenhouse-Geisser and Huhn-Feldt.  These tests and correction factors are commonly used in the journals for experimental and other psychology reports.  I have been switching from SPSS to R for over a year now, but I realize now that I don't have the non-sphericity test and correction factors. The backgroud to this question is that I'm doing a psychophysics experiment and the data analysis uses an aov model that looks like this: roiAOV <- aov( roi ~ (Cue*Hemisphere) + Error(Subject/ (Cue*Hemisphere)), data=roiDataframe) where Cue is 2 levels (an arrow on a screen that points left or right) and Hemisphere is 2 levels (brain activity in the left or right cerebral hemisphere).  There are 8 subjects and they all have one observation for all levels of Cue * Hemisphere (ie, a within-subjects design). I need some functions for calculation of Box's M and the Greenhouse- Geisser correction factor.  Below is some code example that I have for the latter, but I don't know how to adapt it so it can take the aov object. # BEGIN CODE BLOCK # see pp. 45-47 of # http://www.psych.upenn.edu/~baron/rpsych.pdf # --- # create some data x0 <- rnorm(30) x2 <- rnorm(30) x4 <- rnorm(30) data <- cbind(x0,x2,x4) # n is the number of 'subjects' or rows; while # k is the number of levels in the factor (columns), # which is the number of repeated measures n <- dim(data)[1] k <- dim(data)[2] # if k <= 2, the epsilon correction is not required. # When the data are perfectly spherical, epsilon = 1. # The minimum value possible for epsilon is epsi = 1 / (k - 1) # if epsi == 1 and k == 2, quit now... # --- # calculate variance-covariance matrix # diagonal entries are variance, # off-diagonal are covariance S <- var(data) # --- # Now estimate Epsilon D <- k^2 * ( mean(diag(S)) - mean(S) )^2 N1 <- sum(S^2) N2 <- 2 * k * sum( apply(S,1,mean)^2 ) N3 <- k^2 * mean(S)^2 epsi <- D / ( (k-1) * (N1 - N2 + N3) ) # e is used to modify the degrees of freedom for the # F test, so we have (k-1) becomes epsi(k-1) and also # (k - 1)(n - 1) becomes epsi(k - 1)(n - 1).  The new # p-value for the F statistic is found with the # pf() function.  For example, if we have # df1 =  k - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2 # df2 = (k - 1)(n - 1) = (3 - 1)(10 - 1) = 18 # F = 40.719 # then the adjusted 2-tailed p-value is given by: # Fvalue <- 40.719 Pepsi <- 2 * (1 - pf(Fvalue, df1=epsi*(k-1), df2=epsi*(k-1)*(n-1) ) ) # Huynh-Feldt correction # The Greenhouse-Geisser epsilon tends to underestimate # epsilon when epsilon is greater than 0.70 (Stevens, 1990). # An estimated e=0.96 may be actually 1. Huynh-Feldt # correction is less conservative. The Huynh-Feldt # epsilon is calculated from the Greenhouse-Geisser epsilon, epsiHF <- (n * (k-1) * epsi - 2) / ((k-1) * ((n-1) - (k-1)*epsi)) PepsiHF <- 2 * (1 - pf(Fvalue, df1=epsiHF*(k-1), df2=epsiHF*(k-1)*(n-1) ) ) # MANOVA (and multivariate tests) may be better if the # Greenhouse-Geisser and the Huynh-Feldt corrections do not agree, # which may happen when epsilon drops below 0.70. When epsilon # drops below 0.40, both the G-G and H-F corrections may indicate # that the violation of sphericity is affecting the adjusted p-values. # MANOVA is not always appropriate, though. MANOVA usually requires # a larger sample size. Maxwell and Delaney (1990, p. 602) suggest # a rough rule of thumb that the sample size n should be greater # than k+10. # END CODE BLOCK ______________________________________________ R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help PLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.",0
