The paper is available on the Publications page of my website, www.EHirst.com << File: http://www.ehirst.com/ >> . Please let me know if you have any comments on the paper. Here is a summary of the paper:         California was supposed to show the rest of the nation a brighter electricity future. That future, as outlined by the California Public Utilities Commission in 1994, envisioned an electricity industry featuring competitive markets. Such markets were intended to produce lower costs and more choices for consumers, while ensuring profits for efficient energy suppliers and encouraging the retirement of old, inefficient power plants.         Although the first two years of restructuring (beginning in April 1998) seemed to bear out these promises, the last year has been a disaster for California's electricity consumers, taxpayers, and electric utilities. Part of the fallout from California's electricity crisis is considerable concern-even opposition-in other states to restructuring the electricity industry.          Although a few states have decided, based on the California experience, not to restructure, I believe that is the wrong outcome. Instead, the primary lessons other states should learn from California are that competitive markets can work; competition is not to blame for California's problems; and basic economic principles of supply, demand, and prices affect market outcomes.         Section 2 of this paper briefly reviews the history of electricity regulation and restructuring in California and the problems that occurred beginning in May 2000. Section 3, the heart of this paper, offers guidance to other states on the key ingredients of a competitive electricity industry. This section makes several points:   Maintain a favorable investment and regulatory climate for new generation to ensure that enough generation capacity is online and planned to meet growing loads.   Ensure that enough infrastructure (transmission capacity and natural gas pipeline capacity) is in place and planned to meet growing loads, maintain reliability, connect new generators to the grid, support large regional markets, and provide fuel to power plants.   Encourage retail customers to participate in dynamic-pricing and voluntary-load-reduction programs (i.e., couple retail and wholesale markets).   Create honest retail competition: avoid standard-offer rates with artificial discounts and create conditions that encourage many companies to offer retail services without favoring individual competitors.   Encourage electricity suppliers to manage and diversify their supply and price risks.   Create efficient and integrated wholesale markets for energy, ancillary services, and transmission congestion.   Monitor and minimize horizontal market power (generation) and vertical market power (combined ownership and operation of generation and transmission).           Ultimately, competitive markets for electricity will lower costs and prices, better align consumer prices with producer costs, improve producer efficiency in both investment and operation, maintain or improve reliability, and yield greater innovation in customer services and pricing options.          But, this transition from one industry structure to another is turning out to be long and complicated. It is complicated because electricity is so important to our modern, high-tech society; electricity is our most flexible fuel, providing light, heat, motive power, and the energy to operate all our electronic equipment. Also, electricity truly is a real-time product for which production and consumption must occur at the same time.          Although the problems that have occurred in California are substantial and worrisome, regulators and legislators in other states should focus on the long-term benefits of competitive electricity markets and accept the possible short-term problems that may occur. They also need to recognize that wholesale markets are regional in scope and extend far beyond the boundaries of any single state. Finally, competition in retail and wholesale markets must be coordinated; in particular, it is not possible to have competitive wholesale markets unless at least some retail load faces time varying prices.          If states restructure properly to create competitive markets for wholesale energy and retail services, we should all benefit. Consumers will enjoy lower prices, they will have many more choices of energy services and price-risk tradeoffs, reliability will be improved because most reliability services will be obtained through markets instead of by engineering edict, and the financial risks associated with building and operating power plants will be assigned properly to investors rather than consumers.

I will first introduce myself as DR.EVERES HENRY, a staff in the audit section of a well-known bank, here in London, England.   One of our accounts, with holding balance of 26,000,000 (Twenty Six Million Pounds Sterling) has been dormant and last operated three years ago. From my investigations and confirmation, the owner of the said account, a foreigner by name John Shumejda died on the 4th of January 2002 in a plane crash in Birmingham; you can view this CNN website: (http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/01/04/england.plane/)for details on the crash. Since then, nobody has done anything as regards the claiming of this money, as he has no family member that has any knowledge as to the existence of either the account or the funds; and also information from the National Immigration also states that he was single on entry into the UK.   After detailed investigations on the deceased and his account, I found out there is no mention of any heirs or family member on the account document in the Bank records, therefore the money was lodged secretly into the account. Plans are to transfer the fund out with your sincerely help. This transaction is totally free of risk and troubles as the fund is legitimate and does not originate from drug, money laundry, terrorism or any other illegal act.  On your interest, let me hear from you URGENTLY. I look forward to hear from you soonest.  May God bless you.

Dear Friend,  I am Mr.Brian Capon the system and control director at the NATIONAL WESTMINISTER BANK.I am writing this letter to solicit for support and assistance from you to carry out this business opportunity in my bank.  Lying in an inactive account is the sum of 11million pounds sterling belonging to a foreign customer(Michael Gambone) who was a gas consultant here in UK,who happens to be deceased during a business trip. He died with his wife(Deborah Gambone) on board the Swissair Flight 111 , which crashed into the Atlantic off Nova Scotia in september 2nd 1998. The news of this crash was on the news which we have notified his relatives to no avail.See links below for more detail information:  http://cnnstudentnews.cnn.com/WORLD/9809/swissair.victims.list/ http://cnnstudentnews.cnn.com/WORLD/americas/9809/08/swissair.02/  Ever since he died the bank has been expecting his next of kin to come and claim these fund. To this effect, we can not release the money unless someone applies for it as next of kin, as indicated in our banking guideline.Unfortunately he has no family member in UK or Over-sea who are aware of the existence of the money(as he was a gas consultant. At this juncture i have decided to do business with you by soliciting your assistance in applying as the next of kin to the bank then the money will be released to you,as I do not want this money to go into the bank treasury as an unclaimed bill,because the banking law and guideline stipulates that if such money(s) remains unclaimed  for a period of up to nine years(9yrs),the money will be transferred into the bank treasury as an unclaimed bill. My request for a foreigner as next of kin is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a British cannot stand as next of kin.  50% of the money will be your share as a foreign partner and your assistance to actualise this business,thereafter i will visit your country with your help once the money hits your account for disbursement according to the percentage indicated. To effect the immediate transfer of the fund to you as agreed,you must apply first to the bank as the next of kin to the deceased,then we will follow up all formalities for the transaction.  Upon receipt of your reply, i will send to you, the text of the application you are to send to the bank,and further clearify you in other issues as to effect this business. Awaiting to hear from you urgently.  Best Regards Mr.Brian Capon.",1

legitimate,phishing,True,"Assessing the post September 11 Landscape: CERA's New Global Energy Initiative Assessing the post September 11 Landscape: CERA's New Global Energy Initiative  The uncertainties created by the attack on September 11 and the global response have created turmoil for near-term energy planning and investment decision making. Circumstances demand rapid reassessments of near-term risks and strategies. In response to client requests, CERA is undertaking a comprehensive, new initiative to develop a framework for understanding potential energy futures and their implications.  This special multiclient project will include interactive analyses, face-to-face workshops, and real-time updates. It will draw on CERA's broad industry and regional expertise, offering participants both a framework and a robust tool for evaluating strategies across all sectors of the energy business and all geographies. The focus will be on creating new and highly relevant insights into the energy future and the political and economic context. It will highlight both key trends and probable discontinuities -- and assess urgent issues in a setting that will promote thoughtful and informed dialogue.  By emphasizing both virtual and in-person exchanges among participating members and CERA experts, we will establish a three-year road map for decision makers across the energy business, to complement CERA's industry-specific and shorter-term analyses. In addition, the process will offer a unique opportunity to interact with others across the energy spectrum and to share ideas and experiences.  * Could the economic slowdown be prolonged and inflation be rekindled? * What is the impact on energy demand -- does the fuel mix shift? * How great are the risks for disruptions of supply? In which countries and for which fuels? * How would disruptions play out?  And how tumultuous will they be for energy companies? * How will energy policies change -- relative to energy security, environmental trade-offs, and fuel strategies? * Will the global coalition hold, or are we moving to a more divided and more fractured world? * How profound will be the changes for the energy business?  This timely series provides a three-year horizon that draws on the framework established in CERA's longer-term scenarios. It uses the clash between the ""Fragmentation"" and ""Globality"" scenarios as the starting point for assessing the new world in which energy-decision makers will operate and the critical choices they will face.  The first workshop will be held in Houston on November 15, in conjunction with CERA's Fall Roundtable series.  Additional workshops, both in Houston and other cities and via online technologies, will follow. We will announce the entire schedule, with events and deliverables, soon. The process will deliver a clear framework for anticipating the future, and conclusions for energy strategy.

phishing,legitimate,True,"KINDLY ASSIST URGENT RESPONSE  Hi Friend, In recent times over the radio in AMERICA or even in ASIA you must have heard about my family regarding huge sums of money stacked in foreign banks in different names for business. I believe, is a legacy we came to meet, when my late Husband became the head of state. It does not matter whether you are small or big but your ability to help me sort out things is mostly needed now. I do not justify myself but it has happened, so i need you to help me and my family survive in life.Thus it is with hope that I write to  seek your help in the context below.  I am Hajia Mariam Abacha, wife of Nigeria's former head of state; Late General Sani Abacha, whose sudden death occurred on the 8th of June 1998.  Since my husband died, I have been thrown into a state of utter confusion, frustration and hopelessness by the present civilian administration.  The security agents in the country have subjected me to physical and psychological torture. My son (Mohammed Abacha) is still under detention arraigned before the federal high court of Nigeria for an offence he did not commit. As a widow that has been traumatized, I am hopeless with my present faith. You must have heard over the media reports on the recovery of various sums of money deposited by  my late husband with various security firms. Some companies willingly gave up their secret and disclosed  our money confidently lodged there, or many, outright blackmail. Infact the total sum discovered by the government so far is in the tune of $700 to $600 Million USD and they are not relenting to make me poor for life.   I came in contact with your name and address through my personal research and would want to have faith and confidence in you as I view you to be of responsible personality. I have no doubt about your capacity and goodwill to assist me in receiving into your custody (for safety) the sum of $70.3 Million USD willed and deposited safely in my favour by my late husband. This money  is currently kept in Safe Deposit Box (SDB) at a security firm within Europe.  As it is legally required, the administration of my late husband's property is under the authority of the family's Lawyer(Attorney).  The investigative teams set up by my government have submitted their report after freezing almost all our account.Fortunately, our family lawyer had secretly protected the personal will of my husband from the notice of the investigators and have strictly advised that the$70.3m USD be urgently moved to an overseas account of any trust worthy but ANNONYMOUS foreign family   friend without delay, for security reasons.All our traveling papers have been seized by the government thereby preventing us from traveling and all the local and international outfit of our business empire seized.  This sum of money is our only hope to stay alive. I have therefore agreed to compensate your good self with 30% of the total deposit only when you recieve the deposit box from the security firm and its contents safely lodged in your account. They have equally guaranteed 100% risk-free and smooth transfer. If you are interested in assisting me, please reach me immediately and send to me your confidential telephone and fax number(s) so that I or my son mustapha can reach you as soon as possible.   For obvious security reasons, it is imperative that you  keep all our communication very secret. Do not mention my family`s name or disclose the transaction to anybody. If you are not interested in assisting me, please still get in touch so that I can make alternative arrangement as time is of the essence.Please do not expose me to my government.   You can browse on the links below for more information concerning my family's predicament.

The Frenchman was amazed, so he said, ""I want a wall around France, so that no one can come into our precious country.""  Again, with a blink of the Genie's eye, 'POOF'  -  there was a huge wall around France.  The Englishman asks, ""I'm very curious. Please tell me more about this wall.

The professor moves on to Germany: ""Well, I find the most efficient way is to grab her with my velcro gloves, and we're well away.

The professor is excited to have found some national variation and tells Pierre that this is different to the methods of the Scots, Welsh and Germans.

Iraqi insurgents joined 10,000 U.S. troops in the offensive and took control of several areas north of Baghdad today. David Martin will have the latest.     And our chief foreign correspondent Lara Logan will update us on the orphanage story she reported on Monday. She'll give us some encouraging news about how the once-neglected Baghdad orphans are doing now.      Back in the United States, a South Carolina community is beginning the process of mourning nine firefighters who died in massive furniture factory blaze. Tonight, Kelly Cobiella will share the story of one man who escaped from the inferno.      And there's extraordinary new animation that shows more clearly than we've seen before why the World Trade Center towers collapsed on 9/11 after being hit by airplanes.     What if a Web site could tell you that going to one hospital in your area rather than another could dramatically improve your odds of survival? Now, one has been set up by the U.S. government. Wyatt Andrews will give you all the details.     Finally, it's been 35 years since the Watergate scandal drove former President Richard Nixon out of office. Now historians at the National Archives are poring over his speeches, gifts and recordings - yes, even that 18  minutes of blank tape - for installation at the Nixon Library. Richard Schlesinger will take us inside the vault for a fascinating history lesson.

phishing,legitimate,True,"REPLY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE   MR. MING YANG HANG SENG BANK LTD. 83, Des Voeux Road., Central HK, Hong Kong. mingyang_h@yahoo.com.hk  Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Ming Yang director of operations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd. I have an obscured business suggestion for you.  Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client Gen. Aadel Akgaal Bastaan  who was with the Iraqi forces and also businessman made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several notices was sent to him, even during the war which began in 2003. Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that the General along with his wife and only daughter had been killed during the war in a bomb blast that hit their home. You can read more about the bombings on visiting these sites below:  1. http://www.ccmep.org/usbombingwatch/2003.htm#3/19/03  2. http://civilians.info/iraq/deaths_data.php   After further investigation it was also discovered that Gen. Aadel Akgaal Bastaan  did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Twenty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the laws of my country at the expiration 3 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Gen. Aadel Akgaal Bastaan  so that you will be able to receive his funds.  WHAT IS TO BE DONE:  I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Gen. Aadel Akgaal Bastaan, all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favour for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.  There is no risk involved at all in this matter, as we are going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue. Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall then share in the ratio of 70% for me, 30% for you. Should you be interested please send me your full names, private phone/fax and current residential address and I will prefer you reach me on my private email address below: mingyang_h@yahoo.com.hk and finally after that I shall provide you with more details of this operation.  Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.

However, weak market fundamentals, including a sluggish economy and increased  US and Canadian supplies, will mitigate the usual winter price rise. CERA  expects an average Henry Hub price of $2.35 in November.  *  Although inventories are close to record levels, storage pressures are  increasingly unlikely to drive cash markets down significantly this year.   *  Gas demand will average 14 percent lower than a year earlier; residential  and commercial sectors show a decline with a return to normal weather, while a  weak economy offsets the return of ammonia and dual-fuel loads in the  industrial sector.  *  Regional storage inventories and weak regional demand should keep upward  pressure off of regional differentials.

Michael's Minute:  Lindows.com Report Card  As summer arrives, many school children are coming home with their report cards.  I thought this would be a good time to see what kind of grades Lindows.com received for their first 9 months in operation..   To view the Timeline of Lindows.com's first 9 months in business, click here  .  Operating System:   As of last week, consumers can experience LindowsOS in one of two ways. One way is to buy a computer running LindowsOS from Walmart.com  , for as little as $299. This is a significant milestone for us, as we've partnered with our first builder (Microtel) and retailer (Walmart). These computers work great out of the box and are ideal for general purpose computing tasks.  For those who already have a computer and also wish to try LindowsOS, we offer the Insider program  . This gives people wanting early access to LindowsOS a chance to try out LindowsOS as it develops. Currently, Insiders report installation success about 80%  of the time on their PCs. Therefore we have some room to grow, consequently, this product is not yet for everyone.  Some may wonder how we can sell a computer at Walmart  when the program available directly from Lindows.com is billed as not completely ready. The difference is the Walmart   computers are certified, ensuring that all components  work elegantly with LindowsOS. That's much different than offering a software program that will work on any computer in the world - that's very difficult. It's the difference between making a single pair of shoes for a known foot size versus opening a shoe store with every style of shoe for every size foot. The first one is easy, the second one is a much bigger job. While the installer is fantastically easy and fast (the entire OS installs in under 5 minutes), we've got a lot more work to do to support a wider range of hardware, printers and other devices. Grade:  B   _____   Software:  Our goal to give people choice means giving them choice not just on their operating system, but access to all the programs they'll want to add to their computer to really make it work for them in their school, home or business. Click-N-Run   is the easiest way to load software onto a computer. For the first time a Linux based system has leapt ahead of Microsoft's operating systems in ease of use. With 1,000 plus programs already in the Click-N-Run Warehouse  , users can find quality software titles for just about any computing task and, with a single mouse-click download, install and run these programs. All these titles are included in the $99. This is a fantastic consumer experience and price point. Look for a lot more great software in the Warehouse in the future. Grade: A-   _____   Microsoft Windows Compatibility: We live in a Microsoft world, so there needs to be a bridge from the legacy world to the broadband LindowsOS world. This means we need to support some bridge programs, file types and network devices to help people interact with the legacy Microsoft world. LindowsOS computers come with software to view, print and copy popular Microsoft applications like: MS Word files, MS PowerPoint files and MS Excel documents. There's great Linux based alternatives and we'll guide people to those alternatives (they're better than most people realize). To edit Microsoft files, we'd highly recommend one of the office suites in our Warehouse such as OpenOffice  .  Many of these programs are of very high-quality and a great value since they're included in the Warehouse  . Sometimes there are no viable alternatives for those programs, so we're investing necessary resources to support some Microsoft Windows based programs. Stay tuned for more developments in this area. Our printer support is ok, but there's lots of room for more drivers. Connecting to MS Windows based file servers is still a challenge. We need to get better in the above areas.  Grade: B    _____   Communication: We've tried to be diligent in communicating where our company is going which is why there's typically a weekly Michael's Minute  . While our overall goal has not deviated - Bringing Choice To Your Computer - our implementation has become more focused as we listened to what our Insiders and potential customers have told us. (Keep sending me your comments.) We have been de-emphasizing running Microsoft Windows programs because many of you told us you detest spending hundreds of dollars on individual software programs, forced upgrades and activation codes. It's not just the operating system, but costly Microsoft programs you're wanting to avoid.  Consequently, we've been emphasizing Click-N-Run because it will change the way you think about software. Having a neatly categorized library   of 1,000+ software titles all for a flat annual fee at your digital fingertips is an entirely new way to think about paying for software. It's immediate, elegant and affordable. There are lots of mischaracterizations about Lindows.com swirling around - which happens when you have a small organization which can't address every question or publication. We'll do a better job of addressing these in the future. For now, I wrote up answers to the Top Myths about Lindows.com. Check them out by visiting: www.lindows.com/myths  Grade: B+   _____   Overall: B+ Michael Robertson Please visit support.lindows.com   to answer questions you may have about LindowsOS or Lindows.com. Bringing Choice to Your Computer!    LindowsOS is presently available on LindowsOS Certified Computers being offered from Lindows.com   Builder partners.  The General Release of LindowsOS (available now for download and preview to Lindows.com   Insider partners) will be made available later this year for those wishing to install and run LindowsOS on their existing computer hardware.

phishing,legitimate,True,"I NEEDED YOUR IMMEDIATE ATTENTION THANKS FROM MR JOHNSON MUGABE.  E-MAIL ; mm_m_17johnson@yahoo.com.au  DEAR SIR,  Compliments of the day,I understand quite well that this message will sound so strange to you but it is a very serious matter that we need to tackle together very urgent. Before i proceed further,Let me formally introduce myself to you .I am MR. JOHNSON MUGABE, 30 years of age, the first adopted son of president Robert Mugabe, the current Zimbabwean President. I am contacting you today for an urgent assistance to transfer into your account the sum of US$ 19.8 ( NINTEEN POINT EIGHT MILION STATES DOLLARS).  I hope that you may be aware of the recent differences that is going on rigth now between my father and the opposition party in my country, this also brought about the commonwealth community sanctioning my father and freezing all his foreign account both in America and britain.This decision was carried out during the 4 days Commonwealth meeting that was held in Malawi in a part of South East Africa recently.  It will interest you to hear that i never supported my fathers treatment to the white zimbabwean citizens, and this has seriously brought about some personal misunderstanding between me and my father.I have been opposing him since the past five (7) years. Fight so hard to see that he leaves the presidential seat after governing for past 32 years On this account i disassociated myself from him and we do not have any thing in common right now.He even forced me to leave the country with immediate effect after receiving the sanction from the common wealth community, Although he thought that i am behind his delimma. In the year 2004 when i was in good term with my father, he gave me a treasure box containing the sum of US$19.8 milion to deposite in a private security company in Thailand for safe keeping, So i did exactly as he instructed me without disclosing the actual content of the box to the security company,every documents was signed and documented in my names and details.This money has been lying in the security company for the past 8 months.  Now that he sent me out on exile, i left zimbabwe to Thailand where i am currently seeking political assylum.My aim of travelling to Thailand was to claim the money and transfer it out of Thailand to any other country that will be safe for investment. I am contacting you therefore on the account that you will support me to secure the fund in good condition and also come over to Thailand so that we can both claim the fund together, and then we travel down to your country for proper investment of the fund.  I have visited the security company and made every neccessary enquiry concerning the fund and it is still intact in the security house.I will compensate you with 7%of the total sum (i.e US$ 1,386 000.00) and i have set aside another 8% (i.e US$1,584 000.00) for any expenses that may be incured during the transaction. Please this is a very confidential matter that needs utmost secrecy and confidentiality, so i am really pleading to you to try as much as possible to keep every aspect of this confidential. Please also do not reveal it to any one as my hope and futture solely depend on this money and if you are willing to work with me and assist me on this transaction,then do not hesitate to contact me immediately by sending me your TELEPHONE and FAX NUMBERS,and reply me through my e-mail address for us to carry on with the next step of the transaction.  Hoping to receive your positive response soonest.   BEST REGARDS,  MR. JOHNSON MUGABE",1

legitimate,phishing,True,"615 PAPER 63 The three papers that we read this week deal with performance of P2P  systems. The   first one examines the ""small-world phenomenon"" - the principle that we  are all   linked by short chains of acquaintances, and its effect on the design of  P2P   systems. In this paper the authors prove that no decentralized algorithm,   operating with local information only, can construct short paths in the  family of   recently proposed network models that are rich in short paths with  non-negligible   probability. They then show that there is a unique model within the  family for   which decentralized algorithms are effective.   This results in the conclusion that   in addition to having short paths, a network should contain latent  structural   cues that can be used to guide a message towards a target, which means  that   minimizing the transmission rate of a network is not necessarily the same  as   minimizing its diameter. The second paper compares the performance of  Freenet and   Gnutella. The two systems are compared along the lines of performance,  fault   taulerance and scalability. While both Frenet and Gnutella are  decentralized   systems, Freenet relies on the ""small-world phenomenon"", while Gnutella  doesn't.   In terms of performance, Freenet has good average but bad worst case  performance.   Gnutella makes a tradeoff of a much greater search effort for optimal  paths and   better worst case performance. Since highly connected nodes are much less  a   factor in Gnutella than in Freenet, Gnutella is better at handling  attacks but   worse at handling failures. Freenet scales better than Gnutella, scaling   logarithmically compared with linearly for Gnutella. The third paper  compares the   performance of Gnutella and Napster. This paper shows that bandwidth,  latency,   availability, and the degree of sharing vary between three and five  orders of   magnitude across the peers in both Gnutella and Napster. It also shows  that peers   tend to deliberately misreport information if there is an incentive to do  so and   that the download capacities of both systems exceed their upload  capacities.   Finally it points out the fact that Gnutella has a large portion of  freeriders.   This means that a large percentage of clients rely on a small percentage  of   servers, which in turn means that the system is highly vulnerable to  targeted   attacks. It seems that it should be possible to design an unstructured  P2P system   that performs as well as a structured one. However, when designing such a  system   several things must be kept in mind: the ""small-world phenomenon"" is your  friend   - use it; different peers have significant differences in their abilities  and the   system should take that into account; freeloaders are a problem because  they not   only take up system resources but can also make the system vulnerable to  failures   and attacks, thus there have to be strong incentives for people not to  freeload.",0

legitimate,phishing,True,"No Confidence in Congress Lou Dobbs Tonight Thursday, June 21, 2007  Tonight, a new Gallup poll reveals only 14 percent of Americans have confidence in the United States Congress. This poll comes on the heels of several others showing Congressional and Presidential approval ratings at the lowest level in years. What in the world is going on in Washington, and what can we do about it? We'll ask and asnwer those questions tonight.  More than 15 million children are at risk of dropping out of our nations schools, according to the Office of Juvenile Justice Department. With already more than a million students not lining up to graduate this year, there is a new outcry for parental involvement in childrens lives. Studies list parental involvement as key when it comes to combating dropout rates. Well have a full report tonight.  Illegal aliens are now taking extreme measures to cross our southern border, including starting fires near observation towers. The Border Patrol says apprehensions are down, but are these new diversion tactics to blame? We'll have a special report.  Senators Ted Kennedy and Dianne Feinstein held a press conference today touting the importance of a provision for illegal alien agricultural workers in the Senates immigration reform bill.  Meanwhile Senators Jim DeMint, Chuck Grassley and David Vitter are held a press conference discussing why the Senates so-called grand compromise will only repeat the failures of the past. Well report on the battle to get the bill back out on the floor.  And well take a look at the latest developments towards the creation of a North American Union between the United States, Mexico and Canada.  We'll also discuss the Senate's grand compromise on immigration with Senator Claire McCaskill. The Senator says we will never get a handle on illegal immigration until we hold employers accountable.

I understand that argument, but I do think it requires a leap of logic (or at least some creative interpretation) to get from the DFSG to this position. While I can see why some people do not want CDDL-licensed software in main for the above reason, I do not think it is fair to call it the Debian position that this is the case; at least not yet.  Counter-arguments: * The bit ""(except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides   otherwise)"" means you don't necessarily have to give up all your   rights. There are parts of copyright law in most jurisdictions that   give unalienable rights to users; those fall under the above   provision, by definition. The net result of your first clause   therefore may be, depending on circumstances, that users actually get   _more_ rights than what they started out with if that provision wasn't   there, because their own copyright law doesn't give them nearly as   much rights as the copyright law in the country where the software was   written would. * Your second quote is a non-issue. The same is true for GPL-licensed   software; if not, then why did we have to consult two lawyers back   when we moved crypto to main? And why do we still have such insane   procedures today when some crypto-using software gets through NEW?   (you don't see them because ftp-masters handle them, but they're still   there).  Additionally, personally I don't think it's unreasonable for people to say ""if you use my software in a way that I didn't want you to, I'll sue you in a court that works by a set of rules that I'm actually comfortable with"". You know, it makes fighting those who do not follow your license the way you intended them to quite a bit easier.  --  Shaw's Principle: 	Build a system that even a fool can use, and only a fool will 	want to use it.   --  To UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org with a subject of ""unsubscribe"".

Now, in the continuing economic    downturn,  foreign  workers  are  being  blamed  for  displacing their    homegrown counterparts.     Wednesday,  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., will introduce a bill crafted    to  close  loopholes  in  employment  visa  laws,  which he says allow    companies  to  hire  foreign  employees  and  outsource  them to other    companies.     ADVERTISEMENT     IFRAME:    http://ad.doubleclick.net/adi/eweek.dart/news;sz=336x280;ord=456641793    3?    [news;abr=!ie;sz=336x280;ord=4566417933?]      [ew_spacer.gif]     ""We must make sure that our immigration policies don't have a backlash    effect  on displacing American workers,"" Chambliss said Tuesday. ""[The    bill]  will  end the practice of companies who are displacing American    workers.""     The  Senate  Judiciary  Committee  Tuesday  took a look at the role of    temporary work visas in the current economy. The technology industry's    use  of  H-1B  visas  dropped approximately 75 percent last year, with    initial  H-1B visa applications falling to 26,659 in 2002 from 105,692    in  2001,  according  to the Department of Homeland Security Office of    Immigration Security.     Despite  the  statistics,  as unemployment rises in the United States,    lawmakers are hearing from their constituents.     ""I  cannot  tell  you  how  many  workers  came up to me [in August in    California]  and  said, 'I've been replaced by somebody I trained, and    they're  getting  a  third  [the  salary] of what I got,'"" Sen. Dianne    Feinstein,  D-Calif.,  said  at  a  hearing  of  the  Senate Judiciary    Committee  Tuesday. ""Wherever I go, this program comes up and somebody    tells me they've been replaced, and they are angry.""     Intel  Corp.,  which  employs close to 80,000 workers worldwide, hires    individuals  through  the  H1-B  visa program when a position requires    unique  or  difficult-to-find  skills,  Patrick Duffy, human resources    attorney  at Intel, told lawmakers. Beginning in 2001, Intel decreased    hiring  overall,  but  it  continues  to  hire H-1B applicants when it    cannot  find  qualified  U.S.  workers,  Duffy  said.  The company has    particular difficulty hiring U.S. citizens for positions in electrical    engineering design and chemical engineering, he said.     Duffy  contended  that  the  H-1B  visa program does not displace U.S.    workers  and  ultimately  benefits  the  U.S.  economy.  Most  of  the    company's  H-1B visa employees studied at U.S. universities and earned    masters degrees and doctorates.     ""These are not temporary workers to us. The H-1B visa is just one step    in  making these workers U.S. workers,"" Duffy said. ""Hopefully they'll    stay with Intel ... the rest of their lives.""     Large  corporations  that  rely  on skilled foreign workers are urging    Congress  not  to pass short-term fixes that will later cause problems    when  the  economy  recovers.  In  the  boom  times  of the late '90s,    Ingersoll-Rand  Corp. had to take people off the payroll when the H-1B    hiring  cap  was  lowered,  Elizabeth Dickson, adviser for Immigration    Services  at  Ingersoll-Rand  in  Woodcliff Lake, N.J., told lawmakers    Tuesday.     ""When  the [foreign worker hiring] cap reverts to 65,000, we are going    to  have a lot of problems that we experienced both in 1997 and 1998,""    Dickson  said.  ""If  we  have a recovering economy, what are our needs    going to be long term?""     The  root of the problem, according to the industry officials, is that    Americans  earn too few graduate degrees in the hard sciences, leaving    the  domestic  pool of adequate engineering specializations too small.    Contrary  to some assertions, industry officials said they do not hire    foreign  workers  to  pay  them  less  than  they would pay Americans.    Dickson  told  lawmakers  that  it  is  more expensive to hire foreign    workers.     ""We  are  mostly  looking  to  hire U.S. workers. They're cheaper, and    there  are  a  lot  less problems,"" Dickson said. ""In the near term we    simply must have access to foreign nationals. If we want to maintain a    global edge, we want to have the best and the brightest working for us    in the United States.""     American  engineers  argue  that corporate America's use of H-1B visas    exacerbates the problem of engineering unemployment. Abuse of the visa    program,  in  particular,  leaves  qualified  Americans  out  of work,    according  to  John  Steadman,  president-elect  of  the  IEEE-USA  in    Washington, D.C.     ""If  we  continue  down  this path, the United States is making itself    increasingly  dependent  of foreign technical expertise, both here and    abroad,""  Steadman  told  lawmakers,  urging the government to support    programs  that  encourage  more  students--especially  minorities  and    women--to go into the sciences.",0

legitimate,phishing,True,"[Ip-health] WSJ: trade deal a small step for generics -- [ Picked text/plain from multipart/alternative ] In Trade Deal, a Shift on Generics  *Agreement Opens the Door To Cheaper Drugs Abroad,  Easing Some Patent Rules *  *By SARAH LUECK*  *Wall Street Journal, **May 17, 2007; Page A4*  WASHINGTON -- A new trade agreement between Congress and the White House contains provisions that open the door to more sales of generic drugs in developing countries. The plan, reversing earlier gains for American drug makers backed by President Bush, marks the first big setback for the pharmaceutical industry since Democrats claimed Capitol Hill.  For now, the provisions likely only affect pending trade deals with Peru, Panama and Colombia. But the plan also signals a broader shift as congressional leaders give greater weight in trade talks to providing cheaper medicines for the poor, even if it means denying the Republican-friendly drug industry some of the protection it says it needs.  The administration ""has permitted the weakening of intellectual-property protections in these agreements,"" said Billy Tauzin, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the drug industry's main trade group, in an interview. ""They were desperate to get continuing trade authority"" from Democrats in Congress, he said. ""The fact is, their leverage changed since November.""  The main focus of the bipartisan trade deal, announced last week, involves requiring U.S. trade partners to meet new standards for giving their workers labor rights and ensuring environmental protections. But the deal also allows developing countries more flexibility in dealing with U.S. drug makers than they would have had under earlier versions.  Specifically, the policy would ease requirements on developing-country regulators to prevent the sale of patent-infringing products. It also releases trading partners from a requirement to extend the time for patent protections as a form of compensation for delays in drug approvals.  Public-health advocacy groups have argued for years that U.S. trade policy under Mr. Bush often protected brand-name drug makers at the expense of poor countries in need of more-affordable treatments. Many of those groups said they weren't satisfied with last week's deal. Even with the changes, they say, the Peru and Panama deals advance many of the protections the drug industry wants -- just fewer than would have existed if the Bush administration had stuck with its earlier trade stance.  *""Compared to the many steps backward that have been taken since 2003, this is a bit of relief for people who want access to affordable medicines,"" said Ellen Shaffer, co-director of the Center for Policy Analysis on Trade and Health in San Francisco. ""Compared to an actual policy that would provide affordable medicines for people and fairly balance that with innovation, it is a small step forward.""*  Trade is just one of many fronts where the pharmaceutical industry faces a less friendly policy environment, after enjoying strong support during years of undivided Republican rule. Some Democrats want to rewrite the Medicare prescription-drug benefit to allow the government to negotiate lower prices with manufacturers. Some Democrats also want to legalize imports of cheaper medications from Canada and other countries. The Bush administration has maintained its support for the industry on those issues, and the Senate has blocked those policy changes.  But on exports, the administration last week changed course. For the last several years, U.S. trade officials and drug companies have worked to push new protections for drug makers in countries such as signers of the Central American Free Trade Agreement.  Companies say stronger safeguards for their patents and proprietary data are needed in many countries, to delay generic competition and make it worthwhile for the industry to continue to invest in research and development of new treatments.  Under the new American trade strategy, the biggest loss for the industry is a change that may shift more responsibility to drug makers for preventing the marketing of patent-infringing products.  Under recent trade agreements, the U.S. pressed countries to agree to ""linkage,"" which requires local drug regulators to make sure a generic product doesn't violate any patents before allowing it on the market. Public-health advocacy groups have said this puts makers of brand-name drugs at an advantage and burdens regulators. Drug companies support linkage because it prevents copies of their products from being sold during lengthy court battles. Without it, companies will have to be more vigilant. To take industry concerns into account, the new policy calls for countries to set up fast procedures for resolving patent disputes.  Another change in the new trade policy would weaken a common provision in past trade agreements: that local regulators ""shall"" compensate drug makers for delays in the process of approving their products, by awarding extra time to sell their products free from competition.  Some Democrats said this unfairly penalizes consumers in those countries for slow bureaucracies. A description of the changes to the Peru and Panama agreements says countries ""may"" extend a company's patent to make up for delays, suggesting more flexibility on what they are required to do to compensate drug makers.  Health-advocacy groups complain the new policy still preserves the data-exclusivity provision used to block generic competition. In many countries, including the U.S., makers of generic drugs can often win approval by proving their products are equivalent to the original drugs. In that process, regulators use test data submitted by makers of brand-name drugs. The data-exclusivity provision typically prevents such use of the data for five years, acting as an effective hurdle for generics. The new policy does, however, place more restrictions on the five-year data exclusivity than previously existed in the Panama and Peru agreements.  *Write to *Sarah Lueck at sarah.lueck@wsj.com1    *URL for this article: http://online.wsj.com/article/SB117936226237705632.html*    *Hyperlinks in this Article: (1) mailto:sarah.lueck@wsj.com  *   -- Ellen R.

( i wonder what the printer though when i had him print 46 , 000 copies of the recipes in one week ! ) needless to say , i immediately quit my job , paid off al my debts in full and started another mailing . to date my revenues are approaching $ 1 , 000 , 000 . 00 in cold hard cash . believe me , you can do the same thing . this is you lucky break that you have been hoping for all your life . you can make your dreams come true . . . do not pass it up ! the most difficult part was finding a good company to provide responsive names . after trying many name sources , i ran across two companies that provided the best names for this program . their addresses and prices are below : mjg advertising 200 names $ 24 . 00 p . o . box 3009 500 names $ 35 . 00 maple glen , pa 19002 1000 names $ 50 . 00 ( 215 ) 643-1328 2000 names $ 75 . 00 ( 800 ) 880-8143 marnico lists 200 names $ 20 . 00 p . o . box 2046 500 names $ 35 . 00 abington , ma 02351 1000 names $ 60 . 00 request # 3001 2000 names $ 95 . 00 making your fortune is as easy as following these six steps : 1 . send a self addressed stamped envelope and $ 2 . 00 cash wrapped in a sheet of paper specifying which recipe you are ordering by number , to addresses # 1 through # 5 at the end of this bulletin . 2 . order at least 200 names and addresses on labels from the companies mentioned earlier . 3 . while waiting for your labels to arrive , remove the name at the # 1 spot and move each of the names up one position . place your name and address in spot # 5 . move only the names and addresses - not the recipes . this can best be done by retyping the set and pasting the new over the original . 4 . have a local printshop print at least 200 copies of this bulletin . 5 . fold the printed bulletins and place in envelopes , seal and stamp them . 6 . when the labels arrive , place one on each envelope and mail them . now here s the best part - the money you can make ! here is what happens when only 10 % of the people respond to your mailing . you send out at least 200 with your name in position # 5 . 20 people send out at least 200 with your name in position # 4 . 400 people send out at least 200 with your name in position # 3 . 8000 people send out at least 200 with your name in position # 2 . 160000 people send out at least 200 with your name in position # 1 . 168420 x $ 2 . 00 each = $ 336840 in about 60 to 90 days ! ! ! of course you are not limited to mailing only 200 bulletins , or to just one mailing . send out more than 250 or do repeat mailings and you will drastically increase your earnings . when you receive 1 , 000 requests for recipe # 3 , sit back and relax knowing that you re soon going to be a very rich person . yes , this is a perfectly legal mail order marketing plan . if you are in doubt , then refer to title 18 , section 1302 and 1341 of the u . s . postal and lottery laws . a product or service must be exchanged for the money received ; in this case , the product is the recipes . this plan also takes honest work , but the rewards are tremendous . keep a careful account of all money you received and money you spend for income tax purposes . there you have it ! the secret to making thousands for yourself . read this bulletin carefully and then reread it again . think about it , do the math and consider the wealth potential this holds for you . then send $ 2 . 00 cash and a self-addressed stamped envelope today to the addresses in positions # 1 below . go for it , order those recipes today . 1 . chocolate cream pie 2 . pineapple bavarian pudding henry w . frye , sr . harold lookwood 24684 atwood ave . 123 skokorat st . moreno valley , ca 92553 seymour , ct . 06483 3 . chocolate walnut cookies 4 . cheese garlic biscuits vincent myers , jr . dlh enterprises inc . 848 n . rainbow , # 351 p . o . box 5854 las vegas , nv 89107 san jose , ca 95150 5 . magic cookies bar acw enterprises p . o . box 3004-332 corvallis , or 97333 i tried a similar program in which the cost was $ 5 . 00 . in that one , the response was only about 3 % . the first time i sent out this recipe program a got my first responses in just one week . i sent out 250 letters instead of just 100 so my percentage of gains was higher . i am trying again with 500 letters to see if i can surpass the $ 141 , 236 . 00 of the last time . good luck to all of you . it really works ! ! ! sally freisch , st louis , il",1

Swift: ECOCBJJ Tlex : 539 ECOBNK.                                     ATTEN:                              RE:TRANSFER OF (USD 45 MILLION)                    In order to transfer out (USD 45 MILLION) Forty Five million United States  Dollars) from ECOBANK BENIN. I have the courage to ask for your assistance to handle this important and  confidential business believing that you will never let me down either now or  in future.  I am MR.JOHNSON  GUBE,the MANAGER of ECOBANK BENIN. There is an account opened  in this bank in 1980 and since 1990 nobody has operated on this account again.  After going through some old files in the records, I discovered that if I do  not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. The owner  of this account was Mr. Destin Pal, a foreigner, and a miner at D&D INVESTMENT  CO., a geologist by profession and he died since 1990. No other person knows  about this account or any thing concerning it, the account has no other  beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that this company does  not know anything about this account and the amount involved is (USD 45M) Forty  Five million United States Dollars).   I want to transfer the [USD45M] Forty Five million United States Dollars into a  safe foreigners account abroad , but I don't know any foreigner,  I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved  to a local bank here, but can only be approved to any foreign account  because the money is in us dollars and the former owner of the  account Mr.Destin Pal,was a foreigner too.   I know that this message will come to you as a surprise as we dont know ourselves before, but be sure that it is real and a genuine business. I only got your contact address from my  secretary who operates computer with believe in God that you will never let me  down in this business.   You are the only person that I have contacted in this business,  so please reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step to  take urgently. Send also your private telephone and fax number including the  full details of the account to be used for the deposit. I want us to meet face  to face or sign a binding agreement to bind us together so that you can receive  this money into a foreign account or any account of your choice where the fund  will be safe. I will fly to your country for withdrawal and sharing and other  investments. I am contacting you because of the need to involve a foreigner  with foreign account and foreign beneficiary.   I need your full co-operation to make this work fine because the management is  ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct information of this  account, which I will give to you later immediately, if you are able and with capability to handle such amount in strict confidence and trust according to my instructions and advice  for our mutual benefit because this opportunity will never come again in my  life. I need truthful person in this business because I don't want to make  mistake I need your strong assurance and trust.   With my position now in the office I can transfer this money to any foreigner's  reliable account, which you can provide with assurance that this money will be  intact pending my physical arrival in your country for sharing and I want to  remind you that your share has been calculated at 35% of the total sum.  I am waiting for your urgent reply so that I will give you more information about  this transaction through my private mobile email navigator: mrgubej@mail.com or my phone contact.  Regards and God bless.  MR.JOHNSON  GUBE.  Kindly call me for more information. PHONE # +229 - 05 17 26.",1

All our transport destinations are under our control. We need our gateway to know if the user exists before hand to reduce filter load. We make sure all of our customers for who we transport to their own server make sure their server let us know when asked and, if possible, restrict any SMTP but from us. But do we still stand a chance of abuse issues? Do you think I still need to be selective to my known transports?  All is well since getting the correct reject code of 550 set, I guess I was getting hammered by my own request :-|  Thanks to all for the help :)  --  Robert",0

Hannah Nguyen was kind enough to send SSCC a bill for October 2001 for 68,243 mmbtu's of gas. The sum of the delivered volumes from Southern California Gas for the accounts SSCC Vernon is paying for seems to be closer to 108,975. Upon advising Houston of the additional payment that would be received for the underbilling, SSCC Vernon received a fax to the effect that actually 109,130 mmbtu's were due. It may be unclear that SSCC Vernon pays for delivered gas volumes, or the volumetric information SSCC faxed to Houston may not have been legible. In any event, attached is the e-file used for the calculation for Enron's review. Best regards, John Ewing  <>",0
legitimate,phishing,True,"[python-win32] wmi, Win32_ScheduledJob and Execution User I've followed Tim Golden's cookbook example to schedule a job via his Python wmi module; however, I need to specify the user account a scheduled job gets executed under (i.e., the process owner).  The cookbook example will schedule a job owned by SYSTEM.  I note the actual WMI library provides for a User and Password option, which do not appear to be visible options from within the python wmi module's Win32_ScheduledJob call.  I am uncertain if the aforementioned User and Password options actually cause the scheduled job to be run as that user?  As a workaround I schedule my job via the Win32_ScheduledJob call and follow this up with a Win32_Process.Create call to ""schtasks.exe"", in which I change the job id's run user (i.e., via the /RU option) to the appropriate user name.  Is there a way I can specify the run (or execution) user of a scheduled job within the Win32_ScheduledJob call or via the wmi interface?  The way I am doing it right now, I could have simply called schtasks.exe directly and had it create the process with the intended run user, which I don't find very eloquent.

Please I got your name and address through a commercial publication via Internet courtesy of S.A.I.E. during my desperate search for someone that could honestly and confidentially assist me by serving as my trustee. I am Mrs. Mariam Abacha, the widow of the late Gen. Sanni Abacha former Nigerian Military Head of State who died mysteriously as a result of  Cardiac Arrest. Since after my husband?s death my family is under restriction of movement and that not withstanding, we are being molested, policed and our Bank Account both here and abroad are being frozen by the Nigerian Civilian Government. Furthermore, my elder son is in detention by the Nigerian Government  for more interrogation about my husband?s assists and some vital documents.  Following the recent discovery of my husband?s Bank Account by the Nigerian Government with Swiss Bank in which the huge sum of US$700Million and DM450Milllion was logged. I therefore decided to contact you in confidence that I was able to move out the sum of US$25Million Dollars, which was secretly lodged in a trunk box and deposited with a Security Company as materials of Inheritance.   I therefore personally, appeal to you seriously and religiously for  your urgent assistance to move this money into your country where I believe it will be safe since I cannot leave the country due to the restriction of movement imposed on the members of my family by the Nigerian Government. You will be contacted by my family Attorney AKINTOLA JOHNSON and my lawyer shall arrange with you for a face to face meeting outside Nigerian, in order to liaise with you toward effective completion of this transaction.   However, arrangements have been put in place to move this money out of  the country in a secret vault through a diplomatic security company, as  soon as you indicate your interest, forward to my lawyer your Telephone  Number, Fax Number and your Postal Address so that he can send to you the Certificate of Deposit and other necessary documents, so that you can help to claim the luggage. Conclusively, we have agreed to offer you 30% of the total sum while  70% is to be held on trust by you until we decide on a suitable business investment in your country subsequent to our free movement by the Nigerian Government. Please reply to this mail urgently and treat with absolute confidentiality and sincerity.

legitimate,phishing,True,"Bike Diary #6 Day 13 Date: Thursday July 5, 2001 Distance: 85 miles Moving average speed: 13.1 mph Left at: 8:00 AM Arrived at: 4:00 PM Overnight in: cyclist shelter in Monroeville, IN Latitude 40 d 58 m 7 s N Longitude 84 d 51 m 55 s W Cumulative distance: 1058 miles  Today I passed two major milestones: I crossed another state border (Ohio to Indiana, and yes, I took that picture of the sign), and I logged my 1000th mile.  Now it's easy to extrapolate forward: if I covered 1000 miles in 13 days then I should cover 4000 miles in 52 days, which is 7 weeks and 3 days, within the range of my 6-to-8 week predeparture prediction.  52 days from my starting date (June 23) is August 13.  I would estimate the error on that prediction to be +/- 4 days, on the grounds that I added 1 day of riding to the first 1000 miles to nurse an injured knee, which extrapolates to 4 days over 4000 miles.  The weather today was fine, sunny with a high in the 70s, and the riding conditions would have been perfect were it not for the damn headwind.  It was from the northwest this time, so I could get a  little component of it behind me every time my route turned a little bit south.  But along the stretches of roads aligned due west it was a real grind.  I should digress on the subject of that headwind.  If I could have a nickel for every time somebody has told me that I am riding the ""wrong way"" across the country because the prevailing winds blow from west to east, then I would start getting invited to Bill Gates' parties.  Generally speaking, my interlocutors do not even appreciate the full difficulty of riding from east to west, because not only are the prevailing winds against you, but so are the prevailing hills.  You may recall from a previous Bike Diary entry my discussion of why it is that one should always prefer to go gradually down hill as opposed to an exhilerating rapid descent that squanders all the energy gained from climbing into wind resistance (this is not my opinion, it is a fact of physics).  Well, if you think about it, Denver is a mile high (5000 feet above sea level), but still east of the Front Range of the Rockies.  The Mississippi River, on the other hand, is only a few hundred feet above sea level.  This is true everywhere as you approach the Rockies from the east (for example, Cut Bank, MT on my route is just short of 4000 feet elevation).  Therefore, going west across the great plains you are gradually climbing, only to rapidly descend again when you get across the continental divide. The eastbounders, on the other hand, get the benefit of playing out their altitude gain gradually over a long distance as they descend across the great plains.  So, why go west?  Personally, I feel that flying to the west coast and bicycling back is the moral equivalent of getting air lifted to the top of Everest, skiing down to the base camp and then claiming to have climbed the mountain.  It is as if you wanted the bragging rights to say you rode your bicycle across the country, but you wanted to obtain them with the least amount of exertion necessary.  If you live on the east coast, and you want to ride across the continent, it seems perfectly obvious to me that what you need to do is ride west.  One should not undertake such a project as this if you want to do something easy.  OK, end of tirade.  Just remember this the next time you meet someone who claims to have bicycled across the country: the westbounders are the real cyclists.  Speaking of westbounders, I may be closing in on some ahead of me. I stopped in at the bicycle store in Defiance, OH to see if they had any news of westbounders.  Apparently a couple, short in stature, had passed through four days ago.  I wonder if this is the same couple making a perimeter tour that I heard about from the scruffy eastbounder on route 20 in upstate NY (see Day 4, Bike Diary #2).  If so, they were 8-9 days ahead of me then and are only 4 days ahead of me now, so I may be closing the gap.  In 10 days I've gained 4 on them, with 4 more to go, so I would guess that I will probably catch up to them in another 10 days, around July 15.  Stay tuned.  I'm spending tonight in Monroeville, IN.  Monroeville is like the set of a Frank Capra movie: you have your supper in the Village Cafe (two fried pork chops with mashed potatoes and gravy and a side salad for six bucks) and a chocolate malted from the Whippy Dip for dessert. The clientele of the Whippy Dip is a small crowd of flirting teenagers, there's a little league baseball game going on the playing field in the city park, and after dark the fireflies come out in swarms. You may have thought that places like this didn't exist any more, but here in middle America civil small town life is alive and well. You don't lock up your bike and you don't worry about it, either.  My accomodation here in Monroeville is a pavillion in the city park that has been set up as a shelter specifically for long distance touring cyclists.  There's a small bathroom with every imaginable amenity from warm shower to washer/dryer for your laundry.  The hospitable residents of Monroeville expect nothing in return: you can leave a donation but there's no obligation.  There's a guest book where you can leave your name, starting point and destination, and from the list of names it appears that Monroeville is a popular destination for touring cyclists: there's a few coming through every couple of days. I scanned the list for evidence of westbounders ahead of me to no avail.  Day 14 Date: Friday July 6, 2001 Distance: 83 miles Moving average speed: 14.1 mph Left at 7:30 AM Arrived at 2:30 PM Overnight in Salamonie River State Forest near Wabash, IN Latitude 40 d 48 m 42 s N Longitude 85 d 41 m 53 s W Cumulative distance: 1141  Although I rode 83 miles today, I only advanced 56 along the route to Seattle.  There were two reasons for the extra 27 miles today, the first was an inadvertent detour first thing in the morning when I left Monroeville headed in the wrong direction.  Here's and important fact for you future trans-America cyclists to remember: the sun rises in the east and sets in the west.  Therefore, if you are navigating the midwestern grid on a sunny morning thinking that you are going west but you do not see your shadow in front of you, then something is terribly wrong. It took me about three or four miles to notice this discrepancy, miles which I had to double back, of course.  The second detour was up to Fort Wayne to pick up some mail that my friends Maria and Kate sent me (thanks Kate! thanks Maria!).  I love mail.  The rest of the day was full of county roads and cornfields in Indiana. The wind more or less behaved itself today, starting the morning from the southeast before settling back into its usual pattern of coming from the southwest.  It wasn't much of a wind in either direction, maybe 5-10 mph.  I could easily have made it a longer day, but there is a real scarcity of services along this particular stretch of the route.  The next campground is 38 miles farther on, and there isn't a motel in the next 87 miles.  I probably could have managed the 38 miles to the next campground, but in deference to my still aching knees I quit much earlier in the afternoon than I would normally.  It looks like I made an impressively early start today, but that turns out to be a bit of a trick.  Although most of Indiana is in the eastern time zone, the state does not observe daylight savings time (except for the part in the cental time zone, just for maximum confusion) so at this time of year I crossed into the central time zone for all practical purposes when I crossed the Indiana border.  My campground tonight is a ""primitive facility"" which translates to no shower and pit toilets.  Generally speaking, I don't much mind primitive campgrounds as they are generally alot emptier than the ones that cater to the RV crowd and provide full hookups (water and electrical).  This one is an exception to that rule: there's hardly a vacant site.  I suppose it must be because of the holiday weekend since there isn't anything terribly exciting to do in the neighborhood. Most of the other campers are sitting in their sites experimenting  with all the noise-making gear they have brought along (firecrackers, car stereos, bongo drums, you name it).  Oh well, after all these days on the road I think I could sleep through anything.  Day 15 Date: Saturday July 7, 2001 Distance: 86 miles Moving average speed: 12.1 mph Left at 9:30 AM Arrived at 6:15 PM Overnight in White House B&B in Rensselaer, IN Latitude 40 d 55 m 52 s N Longitude 87 d 9 m 6 s W Cumulative distance: 1227 miles  I awoke this morning at 5 AM (EST) to the sound of distant thunder.  At first, I didn't realize that it was thunder I was hearing.  I'm accustomed to thunder as an intermitent booming; the sound I hear this morning was a continuous background.  After I had ruled out military aircraft on manueovers as a possible source for the sound I heard, I realized that I was in big trouble.  My immediate thought was ""strike the tent and seek shelter"".  That probably seems strange to alot of people who figure that the tent IS shelter, but you may recall from my first night's experience that if the tent is pitched on a slope, then it provides precious little shelter from runoff soaking through the floor of the tent.  I had once again pitched the tent on a slope, not expecting rain.  In fact, it seemed that most of the folks in the campground were not expecting (or at least prepared for) the rain that came.  By 6 AM I had my gear stowed my gear and loaded on the bicycle, and I moved myself and the bicycle to the only shelter on the campground: a pavillion that protected, ironically enough, the campground's water supply. The water supply itself was nothing but a spigot, but it spilled into a catch basin that looked like it came out of a coroner's office: it was a shallow sink no wider than usual but long enough to lay down in.  The pavillion overhangs this sink by three or four feet on any side, therefore the entire sheltered area was no bigger than about eight by ten feet.  At 6:10 AM the rains came with a vengance.  I cannot remember the last time I saw such torrential rain and so much lightning.  I believe that more than four inches of rain fell during the next three and a half hours, with lightning hitting very close to where I was standing.  I now could under- stand why the distant thunder had been continuous, because I was now standing in the middle of it.  And there I stood, for about three and a half hours, making light conversation with some of the other campers who dared step out in the storm and waiting for it to end.  One guy seemed to have an unnaturally detailed knowledge of the roads and motels of Indiana; when I asked him what line of work he was in he said he was following power lines.  Apparently utilities hire these guys to go around the state following the power lines to make sure there are no trees nearby that threaten to fall on them.  At 9:30 AM it was clear that the worst of the storm had passed and I decided to head out and make the most of what was left of the day. I'm pretty much ready to get out of Indiana, having already spent more time crossing Ohio than I had hoped.  The day started out as a more or less routine one of grinding out miles across cornfields.  The wind was quite strong in the aftermath of the storm, but it had returned to its normal direction (southwest), so I concluded that the rain was probably over for the day.  The weather was hot and humid, and the pace pretty slow.  I ran into some eastbounders in Denver, IN.  I wouldn't have recognized them as tourists because they were travelling on unloaded bikes, but one of them stopped to talk to me.  They are a group of three men in their late 50s/early 60s doing the Northern Tier in sections while somebody's wife drives the camper/sag-wagon behind.  Boy, these guys have it easy: not only are they eastbound but supported as well!  And he had the nerve to complain to me about headwinds!  ""Take a look at that flag"" I said.  My goal for today after I realized that it would be abbreviated by rain was to make it to Rensselaer, IN.  I'm passing through a part of Indiana where the campgrounds are scarce (and so is the population), so I had to shoot for a town with a motel.  Upon, arriving in Rensselaer, I was greeted by a parade of hot-rods (in fact, some locals had stopped me about two miles from town to warn me that it was happening today). I would estimate that there was well over one hundred cars in the parade, and after it was over they proceeded to cruise the town revving engines and peeping tires much to the delight of the townsfolk, who had turned out to the last man to observe the spectacle.  I suppose this is some sort of July Forth weekend event that happens every year.  I ended up picking the B&B for the night since the only other option was a motel on the interstate.  It might have been cheaper, but I would really hate staying on an interstate strip four miles outside of town.  At least this way I could walk around town and watch the cars go by.  I think I was making slightly better time on foot than the cruisers were, but maybe that's their point.",0

This is not so much ""clear"" as ""completely different"", but yes, that is the principle meaning of the word ""materials"" and the ony logical reason why the author would've used the term here.  A court is going to consider what the apparent intent was -- not try to stretch the meaning beyond the obvious.  > Would you expect an art *materials* catalogue to...  Hereafter, you are trying to stretch the meaning to something that it obviously wasn't intended to mean.  You can do that, because the license is POORLY WRITTEN. Which I have already said. Miraculously, you and I appear to AGREE on that point.  One consequence of this is that some lawyer might try to play the same games with the language that you are doing here.  I think the court would laugh in his face, but who knows?  > I'm trying to understand how it is possible to claim that compilers > don't fit the meaning of materials there  That would be by using the *normal*, *first* definition of ""materials"" and not some alternate meaning that has come about by association.  There is also the point that it wouldn't make any sense to require the meaning you are attempting to press: is there even a compiler which can be ""released in source format under conditions of this license""? If not, then it stands to reason that the author, knowing this, cannot have intended to limit compilation to such a hypothetical compiler. This is yet more evidence for an intent which agrees with the obvious interpretation of the language.  So, are you saying you honestly believe the author's intent was to block compilation of changes to his package altogether? If so, why distribute source at all? Furthermore, you believe that having this irrational intent, he then tried to hide it by using a word which *might* be interpreted to support his intent, but whose most obvious meaning contradicts it?  I find that a pretty implausible theory.  Your interpretation is distorts the license's original intent by using alternate meanings of words. As such it may even be semantically correct (that is, it may be within the set of possible semantic meanings of the utterance), but it is pragmatically incorrect (it is not the subset of that set that was meant by the author -- as we can tell from context). Intent is a matter of pragmatics[1] -- the study of situated utterances as evidence for meaning, not semantics[2] -- the study of isolated utterances for potential meaning.  You're pounding very hard on the semantics, trying to broaden the set of possible meanings, and you're not wrong about that as far as you go, but that's missing the point. The question was not ""what could this sentence possibly mean"", but ""what did this sentence mean when the author wrote it"" -- which is what actually matters legally.  The rest of the license, the fact of using the license, the fact of releasing software with source code and the consequences of licensing choices all provide situational information which supports the pragmatic interpretation of the sentence in question.  The fact that courts (or we) have to go beyond semantics to understand the license is a serious flaw of the license, which I've already pointed out, but as evidence of the author's actual intent, I think it is sufficient.

legitimate,phishing,True,"Cabot Wealth Advisiory 7/5/07 - TV, Intelligence and More July 5, 2007  Salem, Massachusetts  By Timothy Lutts  -----  There's Nothing On!  The SAT Measures What?  A Company With Predictive Decisioning Software  -----  My wife recently attended a conference in upstate New York and one night found herself back in her hotel room, turning to the television for entertainment.  Now, in our family, real-time network television is a rare event.    Thanks to Replay TV, a one-time competitor of TiVo in the DVR (digital video recorder) business, our favorite shows get recorded on a big hard disk and we watch them when we want, skipping the commercials as we go.  In fact, the only time we watch commercials is during the Super Bowl.  More often, we read.  In any event, there was my wife, in a New York state hotel room, ""forced"" to choose from a dreadful selection of real-time network TV offerings.  Of course she could have turned it off, but in that dull hotel room in that strange town, she was just searching for a little life, a little humor, a little intelligence.  What she got was bad TV, along with an onslaught of repetitive, often-insulting commercials.  So she called me, and somewhere along the way she asked, ""Why do people watch this garbage?  And why do the networks play the same commercials, sometimes several times during the same show?""  I couldn't give her an easy answer, but I did sympathize, and that's really what she wanted.  Soon after, I googled ""top ten TV shows,"" and here's what I found.  America's Got Talent Dateline NBC Deal or No Deal Law and Order N-C-I-S C-S-I Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader? Two and A Half Men So You Think You Can Dance? C-S-I Miami  I've never seen any of these, which goes to show you how out of touch I am.  But I do know (from reading) that four of them are crime dramas, two are talent searches, two are game shows, one is a sitcom and one is a news magazine that typically focuses on human-interest stories.  Reviewing this list, I'm reminded of the words of HL Mencken, who wrote, ""No one in this world, so far as I know, has ever lost money by underestimating the intelligence of the great masses of the plain people.""  Then, a few days ago one of my editors commented to me, no doubt after viewing one of the those headlines like ""Man Shoots Self in Groin While Attempting To Make Ham Sandwich,"" ""You know, half of Americans are of below average intelligence.""  Upon reflection, it's obvious.  And it's statistically inevitable.    The average is near the middle, so half will always be below the average (technically, below the median, but given the very large numbers we're dealing with, there's little difference.)  And if you don't know the difference between mean and median, you probably haven't crammed for an SAT test lately.  The converse, however, does not mean that if you do know the difference you have crammed for the test recently.  That's logic at work.  And the SAT, now that I've brought it up, is not what it used to be.  In 1901 it debuted as the Scholastic Achievement Test, supposedly measuring what students had learned.  In 1941, the name was changed to Scholastic Aptitude Test, supposedly measuring what students were capable of learning, if they had the proper socio-economic advantages.  In 1990, that was changed to Scholastic Assessment Test, supposedly measuring . . . something scholastic?  And in 1994 the name was changed to SAT (the letters officially standing for nothing at all!)  Finally (or, should I say, most recently, because I suspect there are more changes around the corner), in 2005 the name was changed to SAT Reasoning Test, creating a potential redundancy of the word ""Test"" but only if the first T still stood for Test, which it doesn't.  Reasoning, of course, includes logic, and I like that a lot. I hope they keep that name for a while.  Now, I took the SAT a few decades back.  Two of my kids have taken it and the third is likely to in a couple years.  But something else has changed over the decades besides the name.  In 1995 the yardstick for scoring was adjusted to account for the growing number of kids from less rigorous schools taking the test.  The reason?  The big bulge in the middle of the distribution curve, which had previously been centered at 400, had slipped down into the mid-300s.  To get the mid-point back up, the average verbal score was artificially increased by some 70 points while the average math score had 20-30 points added.  The kids at the top and bottom were barely affected, but the masses of average kids near the middle saw their scores bumped up dramatically.  What does it matter?  Well, a good score helps you get into college.    But is there a correlation between success on the SAT and success in college?  Looking further out, is there correlation between success on the SAT and success in life?  The simple answer is, some, but not a lot.  And more and more colleges are recognizing that; the number of colleges that admit students without regard to test scores now exceeds 400.  But the SAT lives on, and will continue to be here for years to come.  Why?  In part because it's the product of The College Board.    The College Board is a non-profit organization, and while there's no doubt that it works hard to serve the high schools and colleges and families that use it, there's even less doubt - in my mind - that the organization works even harder to ensure its own survival.   ----- ADVERTISEMENT -----  Join Cabot Stock of The Month and get in on the next stock that explodes like these...   * Broadvision-up 670%  * Intuitive Surgical-up 500%  * Yahoo-up 317%  * Amazon.com-up 1,290%  * First Marblehead-up 50%  * International Game Technology-up 110%  * eResearch Technology-up 180%  * NetEase-up 100%  * Expedia-up 114%  * Broadcom-up 97%  * Netflix-up 173%  * Psychiatric Solutions-up 85%  * PetroKazakhstan-up 86%  * Nautilus-up 109%  That's the beauty of Cabot Stock of the Month.

""A financial services firm in Japan has begun offering lower mortgage interest rates to ""intelligent"" customers.  GE Consumer Finance Company is giving discounts to people who have good English or computer skills, and work in ""high-value"" areas such as the law.  The company says more highly skilled workers usually find it easier than others to get jobs and to keep them. They are therefore less likely to become insolvent and default on their home loan.  GE Consumer Finance Company claims this is the first time that mortgage rates have been calculated like this in Japan.  People who have high scores on a test of English proficiency and officially certified IT skills can apply for a small discount.  Those of them who also have certain jobs - such as lawyers, accountants, doctors and financial experts - can obtain further discounts.  If a couple are both employed in the 20 ""high-value"" professions listed by the company, they will be entitled to a major rate reduction.""  It makes sense, and I'm guessing it's illegal to discriminate that way in the U.S.  -----  Getting back to TV, the problem is not just the quality of programming but the quantity of time people spend viewing.  The TV is on for over 7 hours in the average American home, and the average American watches over 4 hours of TV per day.  Worse still, the average American child watches 1,023 hours of TV a year and spends 900 hours in school.  And one thing they're seeing in those hours is commercials.  For broadcast TV, commercials pay the bills, and the advertisers are doing all they can to ensure that the message from those commercials reaches your brain.  But more and more these days, people are working to avoid those commercials by fast-forwarding through them using DVRs.  So NBC recently tested people to see if those commercials had any impact at high-speed.  NBC, you know, wants its advertisers' money even if viewers are watching at fast speeds.  The result, according to a story three days ago in The New York Times, ""judging from the biological reactions, the test subjects were just as engaged while watching fast-forwarded advertisements as they were while viewing opening scenes from the NBC show ""Heroes"" at regular speed.""  When it comes to fast-forward advertisements, ""the assumption has always been that they have no economic value, that they have no communication value,"" said Alan Wurtzel, president for research at NBC Universal. ""But the fact of the matter is we're learning that they are valuable.""  And they're so ""valuable"" to the financial health of the TV industry that the commercial-skipping DVR that I bought years ago can no longer be bought!  But the problem is not just the commercials.  The problem is that every minute spent watching TV is a minute not being used to reflect, to do something productive, or to interact with other family members.  And the result of all this TV viewing, according to a recent study by the Culture and Media Institute, is that ""increased exposure to television correlates with a decline in acceptance of personal responsibility.""  Now, it's important to note that the word correlate was used there.    Officially, there's no established causality.  But my sense is that our country has seen a marked decrease in a sense of personal responsibility; that too many people all too easily blame others for their troubles.  And when personal responsibility shrinks, we get a culture that thinks it's okay to act stupid because somebody else will pick up the tab.  ----- Contest -----  Now, there is an investment idea coming here, but first I want to give a reward to a loyal reader who has chosen to read this far.

Do it now.  -----  And now, finally, here we are at today's stock.  It's about intelligence and it's about marketing, and if you understand how important marketing is to the world, you may like this one enough to invest in it.  You know and I know that at every turn, companies are doing their darndest to sell us things.  At Amazon they know what I've bought before and thus know what to sell me next.  And at Netflix they know what movies I've rated highly so they can suggest other movies they think I'd enjoy.  Those two firms have developed specialized software that serves their individual needs, but for most companies, there's off-the-shelf software that works very well, and a lot of it is coming from a company named Chordiant.  Here's what we wrote in a recent issue of Cabot Top Ten Report.  ""Chordiant (CHRD) makes customer service and marketing software that helps big companies deal with their customers, so that the goals of both the merchant and the customer are met. Customers include 21st Century Insurance, Bank of Ireland, Banque Populaire, Barclays, Capital One, Covad Communications, Cox Communications, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Lloyds, MetLife, Nokia, Prudential, Royal Bank of Scotland, Royal Dutch Shell, Time Warner Cable, T-Mobile, UPS and Wachovia. These are huge blue-chip companies, yet Chordiant is still a small company, and growing fast. Historically, the company has had trouble making a profit (its last profitable year was 2004), but after the first quarter's terrific results, CEO Steven R. Springsteel commented that solid profitability was ""due to the strong performance in our international business, the acceleration of percentage of completion project implementations in Europe, and greater enablement of our partners resulting in fewer Chordiant resources being required on some project implementations."" It sounds good to us. Since then the company has been awarded a patent for ""advanced predictive decisioning technology."" In other words, the companies using this software sometimes know what you're going to buy before you do! As companies come to depend on this software, Chordiant's future is likely to be consistently profitable, and the realization of that is why the stock is strong today.""  Digging deeper, I see that Chordiant has been growing revenues since 2003, and in the latest quarter saw revenues grow 25% from the year before to $32.8 million, while earnings jumped from a penny per share to $0.18 per share.  Analysts are projecting a profit of $0.48 per share this year and $0.72 per share next year.  And the after-tax profit margin was a fat 19.6%.  Trading at 16, it's rather low-priced and thus carries the extra risk of volatility that comes from stocks at this level.   But average trading volume is nearly 500,000 shares per day, and institutional interest is growing.  I'd like it better on a dip to 15, but if it doesn't dip there in the week ahead, 16 may be the best price you'll get.  -----  Editor's note:  To get regular updates on Chordiant, and to get first notice of other hot stocks, consider a no-risk trial subscription to Cabot Top Ten Report.

legitimate,phishing,True,"Victory!  Progressives defeat a right-wing Dem in Congress Dear MoveOn member,  We've been working together for years to make sure Democrats hold to progressive values and stand up to President Bush. It hasn't always been easy. But yesterday, something amazing happened.  In what the Washington Post called a ""stunning victory,""1 progressive underdog Donna Edwards triumphed in her primary against right-wing Democrat Al Wynn. That's one more vote for ending the war, for affordable health care, for ending global warming. And thousands of MoveOn members pitched in time, money, and shoe leather to make it possible.  It's a big deal, because it's not just about this race--it's about reminding the rest of the Democrats in Congress that at the end of the day, the voters call the shots.  We need to build on this success--to keep putting pressure on Democrats who have lost sight of progressive values, even as we gear up to win the White House in the fall.  Our plan is to use grassroots tactics, advertising, and yes, more primary elections. We'll do it hand-in-hand with our partners at the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and Working for Us PAC.  Can you donate $100 to support a major campaign to hold Democrats accountable? Click here:  https://pol.moveon.org/donate/democratsaccountable.html?id=12121-4776693-O.m6e2&t=260  In 2006, we helped Democrats take back Congress from the Republicans. And while many Democrats have stood up against the war and corporate interests, some have folded.  Holding those people accountable is what we're about. In some cases, sending a clear message to Democrats may be as simple as flooding their offices with calls, or running ads in their district on a key issue. In other cases, getting involved in primary elections is one of the best ways to hold them accountable. In those cases, we'll look for more strong progressive challengers like Donna Edwards, and if there is no challenger in the district, we might help recruit one.  MoveOn members joined with union members and other progressives--including, ACORN, Democracy for America, EMILY's List, the League of Conservation Voters, Progressive Maryland, SEIU, Sierra Cub, United Food and Commercial Workers, Women's Voices, Women's Votes, and more--to help put it over the top for Donna Edwards.  Together we ran ads to educate voters, contributed thousands to Donna's campaign, and hit the streets to turn out voters.  A few months back, we surveyed MoveOn members about Democratic accountability and over 78% said this should be a major priority for the year. Donna Edwards' victory is proof that Democrats in Congress who vote like Republicans can be defeated.  Working with SEIU and Working for Us PAC, MoveOn members can help fight for a majority that's not just Democratic, but progressive.  Can you chip in $100 to support our campaign to make it happen now?  https://pol.moveon.org/donate/democratsaccountable.html?id=12121-4776693-O.m6e2&t=261  Thank you.  --Adam, Eli, Daniel, Joan, and the MoveOn.org Political Action Team   Wednesday, February 13th, 2008  1.

We intend to transfer this fund out of this country to a foreign offshore account, but being that we are still in active government service, we are not allowed to transfer any money or own foreign accounts.  Inlight of this we have decided to solicit for your assistance in the provision of a foreign account where we can transfer this fund to. For your assistance we have agreed to give you 20% of the total fund, which is  Four Million, Six Hundred Thousand United States Dollars($4.6million), 70% will come to I and my colleagues and the balance 10% has been set aside for any expense incurred in the process of this mutually beneficial transaction.  We assure you that this transaction is 100% risk free and absolutely legal.However due to the sensitive nature of our  position in government service we implore you to keep this highly confidential. You will be given more details when you contact me on my email I await your immediate reply.  Best regards. william okafor.",1

legitimate,phishing,True,"ping... ping... ping... Some survey-type questions for non-Bell p9 sites...  Out there, who is actually gotten p9 running? (that is, you've got a distribution and you've installed it and gotten a usable system up and running)  Of those, how many still have their Plan 9 partition/machine?  Of those, how many log onto it regularly, or use it as their  system of choice?  How about configurations - who is using what? SPARCS? x86's? Dedicated file servers? WORM drives?  If a Plan 9 archive site opened, would you want to use 9P to talk to it, or FTP? What would you want to upload? What would you want to see there?  How many people at your site use Plan 9? How many develop or do research on it? What are they doing?  Of particular interest would be development work - I think we should have a better idea of what the rest of the world is doing, to avoid messy duplication.  Post your answers or mail them to me, and I'll strip out locations/identities if you don't want to publish to the world that you're running a system that 1) has a user `none' that can be accessed from anywhere, and 2) can listen to a Ethernet promiscuously Oops - that just slipped out. I'm not trying to give bozos ideas (you can't telnet in as none from outside our department anyway) but some better way of controlling access to the `none' account better be dreamed up (not everyone has the luxury of a firewalled system). Grumph.  Another random question while I'm on - are there any good, high-speed point-to-point interfaces to hook up PC's at a fairly short distance (say 0.5m)? It strikes me that most networks are overkill for linking a file server and cpu server, given that they are designed for many hosts and fairly large distances. Neither of these factors apply to a cpu/fs link. A cheap solution to the above would be appreciated.  Geoff.",0

He is expected to miss the game, however, so be sure to put him on reserve this week.  James Allen , RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01 With Anthony Thomas ailing, Allen will likely start Sunday's game against Minnesota. Considering the Vikings lack of a solid run defense, Allen would be a good Fantasy start in Week 11. !  Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - Martin Updated 11/23/01 According to publised reports, Thomas has been listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Minnesota. Thomas is nursing a hamstring injury, and will likely be replaced in the starting lineup by James Allen.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/23/01 Smith played Thursday but was ineffective. He gained only nine yards on nine carries. Smith remained on the sidelines for most of the second half.  Damon Jones , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01 The Jacksonville Jaguars placed Jones on the waivers-injured reserve list Thursday, effectively ending his five-year career with the team. He caught just eight passes this year before being sidelined with a shoulder injury.  James Stewart , RB DET - Hunter Updated 11/23/01 Stewart rushed for 102 yards on 14 carries Thursday, but left the game early with a stinger in his neck. He had missed the previous four games with a sprained right ankle, and is now listed as day to day.  Charlie Batch , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01 Batch was 8-of-19 for 118 yards with no touchdowns, an interception and a fumble before Mike McMahon, who played one series in the first half, replaced him midway through the fourth quarter. Batch said he couldn't plant and throw effectively because of a groin pull. His status for next week's game is uncertain.  Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01 Banks, who sustained a concussion in last week's game at Denver, returned to practice Thursday and remained on course to start Sunday's game at Philadelphia. He sat out Wednesday's practice as a precaution, but all his postgame tests were negative. Kent Graham, who relieved Banks in the 17-10 victory over the Broncos, will start if Banks has a setback.  Rod Smith , WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/23/01 Smith had seven catches for 81 yards Thursday despite playing on a sprained ankle. He also went over 1,000 yards for the fifth straight season. Smith might be the best receiver in football and is a must start every week.  Terrell Davis , RB DEN - JWillie Updated 11/23/01 Davis could be back next week at Miami. He has missed the last two games because of a torn meniscus. Olandis Gary , RB DEN - Frank Updated 11/23/01 Gary broke a bone in his left leg on the second drive of Thursday's game. He is likely out for the rest of the season. Mike Anderson will be the primary back, but Terrell Davis might be able to return next week.  Jeff Graham , WR SD - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Graham has been quiet recently, but may bust out of a mini-slump against the Cardinals. His yardage numbers should be respectable, and he may catch a TD pass. Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Giggles Updated 11/21/01 The loss of tight end Mark Bruener could have an adverse impact on Bettis' output over the final weeks of the season, but you still need to start him every week in your league. Bettis is likely to struggle against a decent Titans rush defense on Sunday, but he'll still give you serviceable stats and may even find the end zone. Curtis Conway , WR SD - Giggles Updated 11/21/01Expect a big game from Conway in Week 11. The Arizona pass defense has been very soft all year long. Kordell Stewart , QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 While the Steelers' passing game has improved in recent weeks, Stewart is still far too inconsistent to merit using on a weekly basis. He faces a weak Tennessee secondary on Sunday, which is a good matchup, but only use him if you're desperate for a starter in your league. Darrell Jackson , WR SEA - Hunter Updated 11/21/01 Jackson should play very well at Kansas City this week. Seattle will use their passing game early on to open up running lanes for Shaun Alexander, and Jackson will be a key receiver for Matt Hasselbeck. Tim Brown , WR OAK - Martin Updated 11/21/01 Raiders QB Rich Gannon should have plenty of time to locate Brown downfield in their game against the Giants on Sunday. Definitely get Brown into your active lineup this week. Charlie Garner , RB OAK - Russell Updated 11/21/01 Don't expect Garner to put up good stats against the Giants on Sunda! y.! Tyrone Wheatley has returned from an injury and New York is tough on the run. Only use Garner if you don't have another alternative on your roster. David Patten , WR NE - JWillie Updated 11/21/01 Patten and the Patriots go up against the Saints on Sunday. While he has been inconsistent all year long, this is a favorable matchup for the wideout. Patten could beat Fred Thomas downfield for a score, and you should consider using him as your No. 2 or 3 receiver. Troy Brown , WR NE - Bass/Hull Updated 11/21/01 Brown has been a very reliable receiver for his owners this season, and has only gotten better since Tom Brady has been throwing him the ball. Expect another solid week for Brown against a mediocre Saints secondary. Antowain Smith , RB NE - JWillie Updated 11/21/01 Smith has been a pleasant surprise for his Fantasy owners this season. He'll go up against a subpar Saints rush defense on Sunday, and we recommend you get him into your active lineup as a result. Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Matty Updated 11/21/01 Gadsden has been very inconsist! en! t this season, and we don't recommend you use him this week against the Bills. Let him prove himself before you consider putting him back into your active lineup the remainder of the season. James McKnight , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 There is a possibility McKnight could beat the Bills downfield for a few long passes on Sunday. However, he is only worth using in very deep leagues. Travis Minor , RB MIA - Giggles Updated 11/21/01 The Dolphins may use Minor a fair amount Sunday against Buffalo to keep the defense honest. He could be worth using in a deep league since the Bills have been weak against the run all season. Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - Russell Updated 11/21/01 Gonzalez will rack up good Fantasy stats Sunday against the Seahawks. While he has been somewhat of a disappointment, you need to keep him active every week. Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 11/21/01 Davis rushed for 84 yards against Denver last week, and was held out of the end zone once a! ga! in. He may struggle against Philadelphia in Week 11, but you may have no choice but to start him considering the lack of running back depth around the league.  Larry Parker , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Parker could get a touchdown pass Sunday against Seattle, as the Seahawks' secondary has regularly been burned by teams' second wideout options. He might make a good No. 3 receiver for this week. Tony Richardson , RB KC - Neal/McKay Updated 11/21/01 Richardson has fallen into a goal-line back role in recent games, and there's a chance he'll get a score against the Seahawks on Sunday. Kansas City should move the ball with relative ease, and if you are in a deep league or a touchdown-only league, he might be worth putting in your lineup. Priest Holmes , RB KC - Russell Updated 11/21/01 The Chiefs will use many plays to keep the Seahawks off balance on Sunday, which should help Holmes roll up some very good stats this week. We recommend you get him into your active lineup despite his struggles against the Jets in Week Nine. Trent Green , QB KC - Bass! /H! ull Updated 11/21/01 Green and the Chiefs slumped badly before their bye week, but should rebound Sunday against Seattle. Expect him to post decent stats against this questionable secondary, but don't rush to start him over a less mistake-prone quarterback.

This is not so much ""clear"" as ""completely different"", but yes, that is the principle meaning of the word ""materials"" and the ony logical reason why the author would've used the term here.  A court is going to consider what the apparent intent was -- not try to stretch the meaning beyond the obvious.  > Would you expect an art *materials* catalogue to...  Hereafter, you are trying to stretch the meaning to something that it obviously wasn't intended to mean.  You can do that, because the license is POORLY WRITTEN. Which I have already said. Miraculously, you and I appear to AGREE on that point.  One consequence of this is that some lawyer might try to play the same games with the language that you are doing here.  I think the court would laugh in his face, but who knows?  > I'm trying to understand how it is possible to claim that compilers > don't fit the meaning of materials there  That would be by using the *normal*, *first* definition of ""materials"" and not some alternate meaning that has come about by association.  There is also the point that it wouldn't make any sense to require the meaning you are attempting to press: is there even a compiler which can be ""released in source format under conditions of this license""? If not, then it stands to reason that the author, knowing this, cannot have intended to limit compilation to such a hypothetical compiler. This is yet more evidence for an intent which agrees with the obvious interpretation of the language.  So, are you saying you honestly believe the author's intent was to block compilation of changes to his package altogether? If so, why distribute source at all? Furthermore, you believe that having this irrational intent, he then tried to hide it by using a word which *might* be interpreted to support his intent, but whose most obvious meaning contradicts it?  I find that a pretty implausible theory.  Your interpretation is distorts the license's original intent by using alternate meanings of words. As such it may even be semantically correct (that is, it may be within the set of possible semantic meanings of the utterance), but it is pragmatically incorrect (it is not the subset of that set that was meant by the author -- as we can tell from context). Intent is a matter of pragmatics[1] -- the study of situated utterances as evidence for meaning, not semantics[2] -- the study of isolated utterances for potential meaning.  You're pounding very hard on the semantics, trying to broaden the set of possible meanings, and you're not wrong about that as far as you go, but that's missing the point. The question was not ""what could this sentence possibly mean"", but ""what did this sentence mean when the author wrote it"" -- which is what actually matters legally.  The rest of the license, the fact of using the license, the fact of releasing software with source code and the consequences of licensing choices all provide situational information which supports the pragmatic interpretation of the sentence in question.  The fact that courts (or we) have to go beyond semantics to understand the license is a serious flaw of the license, which I've already pointed out, but as evidence of the author's actual intent, I think it is sufficient.

But we don't really know exactly why Cho Seung-Hui went on a rampage on the campus of Virginia Tech. For our first story, correspondent Scott Pelley talks to Secret Service intelligence officers, whose exhaustive research into the minds of potential assassins and school shooters will provide valuable insights. Pelley is speaking with the officers today, April 20, and will report this story over the weekend, for what will perhaps be the freshest look yet at the mind of this mass killer.         This past week was also the deadliest in Baghdad - over 200 Iraqis were killed in a single day.  It has become a living hell for citizens of Baghdad just trying to get through an average day, as correspondent Lara Logan reports in our second story. How does one live in such a place? Very carefully, reports Logan, and often with the protection of a weapon, or in the case of Dr. Quoresh al-Kasir, the U.S. military. Nearly 200 doctors have been murdered in Iraq by insurgents intent on destroying Iraqi society. Soon after bullets began to crash through his windows, Dr. Quoresh heard a hopeful sound. ""We heard the helicopters starting to come to the area. My sons and daughter said, 'Oh, Baba, the Americans started to reach the area.'""     Watch  Logan's Reporter's Notebook.        The firing of Don Imus for uttering racially charged and misogynistic words black rap stars routinely use in their lyrics has shifted the spotlight to hip-hop culture and its dark messages.  As you'll see in our third piece, CNN's Anderson Cooper discovers that one of the rappers' popular messages, ""stop snitchin',"" does not help the police, but has actually confounded investigators' efforts to solve crimes, especially murder, and has now created some lawless neighborhoods.  Says Geoffrey Canada, educator and anti-violence advocate from New York City's Harlem neighborhood, ""It's like we're saying to the criminals, 'You can have our community....Do anything you want and we will either deal with it ourselves or we'll simply ignore it.'""     Watch  Cooper's Reporter's Notebook.        These stories, and Andy Rooney's love affair with books, this Sunday, April 22, on 60 Minutes at 7 p.m. ET/PT.

phishing,legitimate,True,"I AM HAPPY TO HAVE YOU AS FRIEND..... My dear.  greetings from miss Fatoumata Saleeby.  I am writting this letter with due respect and heartful of tears since we have not known or met ourselves previously, I am asking for whom to love and love me as well after I have gone through your profile and i just pick interest on you.   I am fair in complexion, I am about 5fit 7in tall, I love sport events, going outdoors activities, watching of moving, shopping, walking etc.In a nutshell, My name is Miss Fatoumata Saleeby 22 years old from the republic of Liberia in west Africa, now seeking for refugee in Dakar-Senegal under the (UNHCR).  I therefore write to inform you that I am the only surviving child and daughter of the deceased Dr. ELIE E. SALEEBY the former MINISTER OF FINANCE / EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CENTRAL BANK OF LIBERIA in the year July 1997-Feb. 2003.  The reason for this correspondence is to formally request for mutual assistance on business relationship with you in order to benefit from your wealth of experience in business.   The secret fact therefore, is that my father kept the sum of US$4,700, 000.00 (Four million seven hundred thousand US Dollars) CASH. The money was deposited at Bank here in Dakar Senegal.   The money is the share of proceeds from a deal executed with my father's colleagues in the hierarchy of membership of the LIBERIAN JOINT PUBLIC TENDER BOARD during a contract award to an Ukrainian - RUSSIA Diamond Extracting Company when my father was a chairman.   Due to the civil war caused by rebel leader Charles Taylor who has just been toppled by another rebel group and my father's status as a civil-servant by law in my country and the sensitivity of my father's position that attracts public attention, he cannot operate a Domiciliary account in order to keep this large sum of money in a bank in my country.   My father retired and died lately before he could withdraw this money here in and transfer it out of Africa. I anticipate to conclude arrangement to start this venture with you as quick as possible.   Due to my youthful age and also refugee here in senegal, decide to claim the money now with a foreign partner.   Upon your indicated interest, we will arrange for a meeting in the country of your choice when the money is moved from the Bank to your account and discuss in details the terms of agreement. I want to invest in any company that you suggest under your professional guidance. Please include your private mobile telephone number in your reply for easy communication.   I earnestly await your urgent response as I expect you to treat this matter with required maturity, attention and committment.   with best regards  Fatoumata Saleeby. v",1

phishing,legitimate,True,"FROM MRS BINTU OMAR  Dear friend,   With warm heart I offer my friendship and greetings and I hope this letter meets you in good time. However strange or surprising this contact might seem to you as we have Not met personally or had any dealings in the past, I Humbly ask that you take due consideration of its Importance and the immense benefit it will be to you.   After careful consideration with my Son, we resolved to contact you for your most needed assistance in this manner. I duly apologize for infringing on your privacy, if this contact is not acceptable to you, as I make this proposal to you as a person of integrity. For the purpose of introduction, I am Mrs Bintu Omar the wife of late Brigadier Barham Omar from Zimbabwe currently hiding in South Africa as refugees. My husband severed in the ZANU PF Government lead by Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe.   He operated in Mozambique, Angola, and Congo formerly Zaire lead by Mubutu Seseseko, during this period He was used as a confidante's by Robert Mugabe and his hierarchy to carry out their shady deals of smuggling Diamonds and gold from mines which were situated in areas controlled by Zimbabwean soldiers.   During this period he managed to accumulate a personal fortune of US$10,000,000 (TEN Million United States Dollars) which he secretly Lodged with a security and finance company here in South Africa as 'precious Stones"" because of the fear of my country president Robert Mugabe   Before the 2002 presidential election in Zimbabwe my husband defected to the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) because he defied an order to send a contingent of his battalion to go and attack innocent white farmers for refusing to give up their land, as a result of that and because of the position my husband held and the secret duties that he executed for ZANU PF he was put under surveillance by the central intelligence organisation and Mugabe's secret police. He was caught and thrown into the prison and later he was killed by Robert Mugabe and is partners Before his death, he managed to smuggle out a letter to me intimating me about the existence of the sum, which he deposited with the security and finance company in South Africa, which he acquired during his operations for president Robert Mugabe and ZANU PF Because of the strong relationship existing between the current South Africa Government and Zimbabwean Government it is increasingly becoming too risky for me and my Son to remain in South Africa. As a result of this I am seeking your assistance to help us (me and my son) clear this fund and deposit it in your personal account in your country for our investment..   For your assistance (I and my Son) is prepared to give you 15% of the total sum as compensation, and 5% is set aside to settle any expenses that we might incur during the cause of clearing and transferring this fund to your nominated account, while the remaining 80% will be for us (I and my Son), for our investment in your company, under your supervision and with you as our fund manager.   What I need from you is as follows:-   a)Your honesty that you will not run away with our money.  b) Your contacts details such as Fax /Telephone and mobile numbers for easy communication.   For more information regarding this transaction, I would appreciate if you contact my son (Ahmed Omar) through his phone number +27-83 8686 990 or email:(barhamomar@hotmail.com) Immediately you receive this letter for more briefings and details.   Your urgent response is highly needed.   Best regards,   MRS BINTU OMAR  (for the family)",1

It's certainly possible to have getpass() read from stdin automatically, but it's traditionally understood that having it read from a tty is much, much better.  Suppose your program were meant to use getpass, and then read a file from stdin.  Now, all of a sudden, you miss the first line of the file, and it becomes your password, for no particular reason.  getpass() works the way it does because it's been working that way in C for decades.  If you really want to maintain a 'configuration file' for your password, or have it available on command line, try adding an option like -p  or -p  to whatever program you're writing.  --  Cheers, Leif _______________________________________________ Python-Dev mailing list zvllln-eum@python.org http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-dev Unsubscribe: http://mail.python.org/mailman/options/python-dev/python-dev%40tangomu.com",0
legitimate,phishing,True,"RE: Transok Offsystem Fuel Accounting Procedure 	I have reviewed to orders issued by FERC.  They state ""Pipelines acquiring upstream capacity without prior Commission approval will be ""at-risk"" for the cost of that capacity"".  This means that Northern will need to track both the costs and revenues associated with offsystem transactions.  We believe that in tracking the revenues we can track by contract.    	Therefore, I believe in the meeting that if we needed to track these transactions Sue's group would maintain a manual spreadsheet for all off-system transactions.  	We also said Dan Fancler would need to review and determine how we would track the revenues thru the accounting side.    	I believe we have provided the answers we committed to in the meeting yesterday for today.  I plan to meet with Lynn B. tomorrow to discuss nominations, contract approval processes and other stuff.....  I'll let you know where we are as things develop.  thanks MW   -----Original Message----- From: 	Fancler, Dan   Sent:	Thursday, October 11, 2001 2:38 PM To:	Winckowski, Michele; Kirk, Steve; Miller, Kent; Neville, Sue; Williams, Jo; Blair, Lynn Cc:	Cobb Jr., John; Chandler, Bob; Kissner, Tim; Brennan, Patrick Subject:	Transok Offsystem Fuel Accounting Procedure  Based on our meeting 10/9/2001, I would like to propose the following accounting procedures for expensing in-kind fuel.  Case A:  In October 500,000 dts moves offsystem with only 486,000 dts expected to be returned to NNG in January.  NNG moves 500,000 dts from physical inventory to Offsystem inventory. No accounting entry made to the G/L.  Gas Accounting would reduce Offsystem inventory 14,000 dts to reflect in-kind fuel reduction in the same month the next NNG gas purchase transaction occurs (FIFO inventory method).  Reducing the Offsystem storage will cause UAF to increase, however purchasing gas for Operational Storage and not recording it to Operational Storage will offset the UAF increase.  If the next gas purchase transaction occurs in December at $3.00 then we would reduce Offsystem Storage Inventory by 14,000 dts in December production.  December UAF would not be affected.  Recorded in December: Debit 858 3rd Party Transport exp		14,000 * $3.00 = $42,000 	Credit A/P							($42,000)  Procedural Note:  All Third Party Offsystem storage statements must be forwarded to Gas Accounting (Dan Fancler) in order to reconcile the Physical to the Books.  Reconciling items such as in-kind fuel reductions will be reported to Storage Marketing noting that purchases for in-kind fuel replacements are needed.  If NNG purchases 100,000 dt for Operational Storage in December, then 14,000 dts would be carved out as in-kind fuel replacement and recorded to 858 (3rd party transport), the remaining 86,000 dts would be recorded as Operational Storage purchase and encroachment.  We may wish for the vender to issue two invoices.   Case B	 In October 500,000 dts moves offsystem, NNG purchases the in-kind replacement on Transok's system and 500,000  dts is expected to be returned to NNG in January.  NNG moves 500,000 dts from physical inventory to Offsystem inventory. No accounting entry made to the G/L. NNG does not reduce the offsystem physical inventory.  Recorded in month of purchase on Transok's system: Debit 858 3rd Party Transport exp		14,000 * $3.00 = $42,000 	Credit A/P							($42,000)  In both cases all transactions are recorded outside of operational storage, but gives Marketing some flexibility on when the in-kind replacement takes place but still follows a logical methodology (FIFO replacement).",0

Email: paulotobo2@walla.com                                             Dear Sir,  It is my great pleasure to write you this letter on behalf of my colleagues. Your information were given to me by a member of the South African Export Promotion Council (SAEPC) who was with the Black Economic Empowerment Commission (Government) delegation on a trip to the United States during a bilateral conference talk to encourage foreign investors. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in execution of a deal hereunder for the benefit of all parties, and hope you will keep it confidential because of the nature of this business.  Within the Department of Mining Resources where I work as the Director of Project Implementation, with co-operation of two other top officials, we have in our possession, an overdue payment in US funds.  The said funds represent certain percentage of the contract value executed on behalf of my Ministry by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced to the amount of US$41,500,000.00 (Forty One Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). Though the actual contract cost has been paid to the original contractor, leaving the excess balance unclaimed.  The Government of the Republic of South Africa believe that private investment in general, and foreign direct investment in particular, are the real engines for sustainable economic development, for which reason it has continued to encouraged investment in the key growth-oriented sector of Mining with sincere determination to pay foreign contractors all debts owed to them, so as to continue to enjoy close relationship, and mutually beneficial co-operation with foreign governments and non-governmental financial agencies. As a result we included our bills for approvals with the co-operation of some officials at the Department of Finance and the Reserve Bank of South Africa (RBSA). We are seeking your assistance to be the beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, since we are not allowed to operate foreign account. The changing of beneficiary's information/ details and other forms of documentation upon application for claim to reflect the contract money and its approvals will be secured on behalf of your company or your self.  I have the authority of my colleagues involved to propose that, should you be willing to assist us in this transaction your share as compensation will be 20% while my colleagues and I shall receive 70%, and the balance of 10% shall be used to reimburse all expenditures, taxes and miscellaneous expenses so incurred.  It does not matter whether or not your company does contract projects of the nature described here. The assumption is that your company won the major contract and subcontracted it to other companies. More often than not, big trading companies and firms of unrelated fields win major contracts, and subcontract to more specialized firms for execution.  This business itself is 100% safe, provided you treat it with utmost confidentiality. Also your specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this mutual beneficiary transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint us. Kindly notify me for further details, upon your acceptance of this proposal.Pls send  all correspondence to potobo1@netscape.net  Regards, Engr Paul O. Otobo. potobo1@netscape.net",1

WEST AFRICA.  Dear Sir,  BUSINESS PROPOSAL AND INVESTMENT IN YOUR COUNTRY   I got your contact through our chember of commerce and  industry.  I am contacting you for a mutual business relationship and for you to act as my guardian in a joint business venture that we will operate together. After praying, my mind asked me to go ahead and contact you for this partnership. My name is PRINCE HASSAN SULEMAN, the only son of Late ALHAJI USMAN SULEMAN. My mother died on the 22nd of October, 1985 of cancer and my father was  assassinated on the 28th of April 2003 by an unknown person in Abidjan, Cote dIvoire. My father was a gold and cocoa merchant based in Ghana/Cote dIvoire.Breifly before he died in a hospital here in Abidjan, Cote dIvoire due to injuries he sustained from the gunshots. He told me about the sum of US$45M(Forty Five Million United States Dollars) belonging to him in a suspense account with one of our local Bank here in Abidjan, Cote dIvoire. That he willed the money to me in his will, with his attorney. He asked me to seek for a foreign partner Who will assist me in transferring the money out of Abidjan, CotedIvoire to a foreign account for investment purpose. Then help me make arrangement after the transfer to leave this country. That those people that killed him may be after me. According to my late fathers will, the money cannot be released to me without a foreign partner until at the age of 37 years. It can only be transferred from the Bank here to the account of my foreign partner  before I attain the age of 37 years. Presently I am 34years old and can not seat here for the next 3years waiting for the maturity date, while my life is in danger. This is my reason for contacting you to assist me present your self as my foreign partner and also provide foreign account where this fund will be transferred to.I have already contacted my fathers attorney here in respect of this transaction. He is waiting to hear from my foreign partner for us to start the process for the transfer of the funds. I would have done this since but according to our tradition. I have to wait till its one year after my fathers death as a mark of respect before embarking on such project. So that it will not look like if I am just after his money like my uncle. Since the death of my father, I have been with my fathers brother in Ghana. Honestly the way he is treating me, make me  to be suspecting him that he knows some thing about my late fathers death.  Based on this, I left his house with out his consent. Presently I am in Abidjan,Cote d Ivoire. He dont know my way about and will never know. This is why I need your assistance so urgent for us to finalise this transaction as soon as possible for me to leave this Country. You will be given 40% as compensation for your assistance and effort before any thing is done with the money. If you are interested and feel that you can handle this project. Please get back to me for more details and as well as indicate your private Tel/Fax numbers where I can always reach you, when the need arises. I await to hear from you. Thanks and God bless.

legitimate,phishing,True,"[R] ANOVA non-sphericity test and corrections (eg,	Greenhouse-Geisser) I'm an experimental psychologist and when I run ANOVA analysis in SPSS, I normally ask for a test of non-sphericity (Box's M-test).  I also ask for output of the corrections for non-sphericity, such as Greenhouse-Geisser and Huhn-Feldt.  These tests and correction factors are commonly used in the journals for experimental and other psychology reports.  I have been switching from SPSS to R for over a year now, but I realize now that I don't have the non-sphericity test and correction factors. The backgroud to this question is that I'm doing a psychophysics experiment and the data analysis uses an aov model that looks like this: roiAOV <- aov( roi ~ (Cue*Hemisphere) + Error(Subject/ (Cue*Hemisphere)), data=roiDataframe) where Cue is 2 levels (an arrow on a screen that points left or right) and Hemisphere is 2 levels (brain activity in the left or right cerebral hemisphere).  There are 8 subjects and they all have one observation for all levels of Cue * Hemisphere (ie, a within-subjects design). I need some functions for calculation of Box's M and the Greenhouse- Geisser correction factor.  Below is some code example that I have for the latter, but I don't know how to adapt it so it can take the aov object. # BEGIN CODE BLOCK # see pp. 45-47 of # http://www.psych.upenn.edu/~baron/rpsych.pdf # --- # create some data x0 <- rnorm(30) x2 <- rnorm(30) x4 <- rnorm(30) data <- cbind(x0,x2,x4) # n is the number of 'subjects' or rows; while # k is the number of levels in the factor (columns), # which is the number of repeated measures n <- dim(data)[1] k <- dim(data)[2] # if k <= 2, the epsilon correction is not required. # When the data are perfectly spherical, epsilon = 1. # The minimum value possible for epsilon is epsi = 1 / (k - 1) # if epsi == 1 and k == 2, quit now... # --- # calculate variance-covariance matrix # diagonal entries are variance, # off-diagonal are covariance S <- var(data) # --- # Now estimate Epsilon D <- k^2 * ( mean(diag(S)) - mean(S) )^2 N1 <- sum(S^2) N2 <- 2 * k * sum( apply(S,1,mean)^2 ) N3 <- k^2 * mean(S)^2 epsi <- D / ( (k-1) * (N1 - N2 + N3) ) # e is used to modify the degrees of freedom for the # F test, so we have (k-1) becomes epsi(k-1) and also # (k - 1)(n - 1) becomes epsi(k - 1)(n - 1).  The new # p-value for the F statistic is found with the # pf() function.  For example, if we have # df1 =  k - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2 # df2 = (k - 1)(n - 1) = (3 - 1)(10 - 1) = 18 # F = 40.719 # then the adjusted 2-tailed p-value is given by: # Fvalue <- 40.719 Pepsi <- 2 * (1 - pf(Fvalue, df1=epsi*(k-1), df2=epsi*(k-1)*(n-1) ) ) # Huynh-Feldt correction # The Greenhouse-Geisser epsilon tends to underestimate # epsilon when epsilon is greater than 0.70 (Stevens, 1990). # An estimated e=0.96 may be actually 1. Huynh-Feldt # correction is less conservative. The Huynh-Feldt # epsilon is calculated from the Greenhouse-Geisser epsilon, epsiHF <- (n * (k-1) * epsi - 2) / ((k-1) * ((n-1) - (k-1)*epsi)) PepsiHF <- 2 * (1 - pf(Fvalue, df1=epsiHF*(k-1), df2=epsiHF*(k-1)*(n-1) ) ) # MANOVA (and multivariate tests) may be better if the # Greenhouse-Geisser and the Huynh-Feldt corrections do not agree, # which may happen when epsilon drops below 0.70. When epsilon # drops below 0.40, both the G-G and H-F corrections may indicate # that the violation of sphericity is affecting the adjusted p-values. # MANOVA is not always appropriate, though. MANOVA usually requires # a larger sample size. Maxwell and Delaney (1990, p. 602) suggest # a rough rule of thumb that the sample size n should be greater # than k+10. # END CODE BLOCK ______________________________________________ R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help PLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.",0

legitimate,phishing,True,"re : transitional assignments all i have received a few notes about this since this one but i will try to respond to all questions here . please see below responses in red : enron capital sally - husband and 3 children - ages 15 , 11 and 2 ) . i understand that the houses which have been vacated due to returning expats have all been filled , so can you have someone arrange for corporate housing that will accommodate them ? i think the best way to go here is for us to use serviced apartments as it will be very difficult to find a lease for such a short period for this type of accommodation . my assistant , lisa , has put a call in to a service who can help us find serviced accommodation in south kensington / chelsea area or in dolphin square where we have people now who are very satisfied . is there a reason you are partial to south kensington / chelsea ? what if we find accommodation in another nice area of london within a short commute to the office ? when i have some options , i will let you know , probably on monday . immigration - due to the fact that they will be traveling back and forth and have made trips already , i feel it would be best to apply for work permits versus using the visa waiver . i have sent them the forms and requested that brent complete his and file immediately to increase chances of getting his sometime shortly after he arrives in the uk . i have informed him that he should arrive without his family if the permit has not been received by april 1 . brent ' s work permit will be submitted today and we may receive if before april lst , but it is unlikely . the way it works for this is as follows : brent will receive the work permit from us and if he is here , he will have to leave the uk and enter with the work permit for it to be validated . if his family are in houston , they will need to receive entry clearance in the us prior to arriving in the uk . this takes approx 7 working days and they will require either brent ' s original passport and work permit or a certified copy of each along with other things such as marriage and birth certificates . if brent decides to bring his family with him to london prior to receiving the work permit , they must say they are coming on a vacation for a short period of time and have a return ticket to back it up . once the permit is received , the family can either travel back to houston and submit the entry clearance visas there or they can all travel to amsterdam where they are currenlty issuing entry clearance without a problem . there is always a small element of risk in going to amsterdam , however , as do not have to issue the stamps there , they just do it because they are nice ! work permits are arriving approx 4 weeks from date of submission . we can discuss all of this on the 20 th . tax - please confirm whether paye will need to be paid for them during the short term assignment and then reclaimed through a treaty benefit . paye is due after 60 days ; however , if brent and sally are really only going to be here for approx 75 days , i am not going to inform the revenue that they are here . if this extends beyond the set time , we can look at options but the only responsiblility that brent and sally will have is to ensure they complete the tax organiser in order for us to get the tax back . also , as we would have to apply the treaty here , we need to ensure the salary costs stay in houston . jane , have you discussed this point ? benefits - i have suggested that they remain on us domestic payroll and benefits and , if medical claims arise that exceed what they would have spent in the us , they may claim the excess on the expense report . agreed . per diem - we need to discuss the appropriate amount based on family size . jane , please call me to discuss . i have left you a message , thanks let me know of any other issues we need to address . as always , i appreciate your help . jane",0

Seven Republicans voted against the proposal, while three Democrats voted in favor. Rep. Johnson (R-Conn.) says the bill, sponsored by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Thomas (R-Calif.), would put $9 billion into state coffers within 10 days of enactment.  The bill would allow states to use the funds to pay regular unemployment benefits, increase benefit payments, extend benefits beyond 26 weeks, expand benefit eligibility, or for administrative purposes. The bill also would extend the work opportunity tax credit and the welfare-to-work tax credit through Dec. 31, 2003, and contains provisions to boost the Social Services Block Grant program by $3 billion so that states can give health coverage to the unemployed. Critics of the bill--including congressional Democrats, labor, and civil rights groups--claim the measure will not accomplish the Republicans' stated goals of stimulating the economy and getting displaced workers back on the job. A substitute measure offered by House Democrats is rejected by a vote of 261-166. Senate Majority Leader Daschle (D-S.D.) tells reporters that he hopes the Senate will be able to pass its own version of an economic stimulus bill before Thanksgiving. . . .

First Unum Life Ins. Co., ""Ark., No. 00-1430, 10/18/01). Reversing summary judgment for First Unum Life Insurance Co., the supreme court holds that because both the insurer and James Elam submitted evidence outside of the insurance policy to support their interpretations of the term ""mental illness,"" the issue is a question of fact for a jury to decide. The policy defines mental illness as ""mental, nervous or emotional diseases or disorders of any type."" Arguing the term is ambiguous, Elam says bipolar affective disorder is a physical illness with a biological origin that is treated with medication. . . . Page A-1 http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/dlr.nsf/id/a0a4w6a7e7_ SIXTH CIRCUIT BLOCKS MOVE TO SEPARATE FLSA, LMRA CLAIMS A former truck driver's attempt to separate claims he brought under the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Labor-Management Relations Act in order to avail himself of the FLSA's two-year statute of limitations falls short, as the Sixth Circuit finds the wage claim barred by the federal labor law's six-month limitations period (""Martin v. Lake County Sewer Co., ""6th Cir., No. 00-00228, 10/17/01). In addition to seeking unpaid wages under the FLSA after his discharge, Donald Martin charged his former employer, Lake County Sewer Co., with violating the terms of its collective bargaining agreement with a Teamsters local in violation of LMRA Section 301. Martin also contended that the union violated its duty of fair representation under Section 301 by failing to pursue a grievance against Lake for allegedly improper deductions in his benefits and pay. Martin argues his FLSA claim is distinct from the Section 301 claim and therefore governed by the wage law's two-year limitations period. According to the Sixth Circuit, however, Martin's charge relating to the unpaid wages was based on the provision in the collective bargaining agreement governing compensation and must be resolved in accordance with LMRA procedures. . . .

Ulster County, ""N.D. N.Y., No. 99-CV-1278, 10/10/01). Rejecting a summary judgment motion by Ulster County Golden Hill Health Care Center, Judge Homer of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York finds that Gail Becker established enough evidence to go to trial on her claims of sexual harassment based on a hostile work environment and retaliation under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and other laws. Her evidence surrounding the assault incident--including her supervisor's failure to allow Becker to call the police and the facility's refusal to allow her time off to seek a protective order--if credited, ""establishes an incident sufficient by itself to support a finding that the conditions of her employment were irrevocably altered as a result and that those conditions became abusive,"" the court holds. . . .

Business activity recovered quickly from some aspects of the attacks, such as reduced air cargo capacity, but long-run effects are more difficult to assess, according to the Fed. New since the attacks, however, are disruptions to productivity due to increased security precautions and insurance premiums, the central bank says. . . .

Volume Last Month: Over 7.3 Million Shares Traded Friday's Close: $.125   Watch This Stock Monday! A Large promotional Campaign is Underway This Weekend. Some of These Little Oil and Gas Stocks Have Been Really Moving Lately. And When Some of them Move, They Really Go...Gains of 100%, 200% or More Are Not Unheard Of. U-C-P-I and X-C-H-C are Two Examples..      Reasons To Consider (E O G I):  *Emerson Oil & Gas holds a 50% working interest in the W.T. Davis well and lands within Township 23 North and Range 13 West of Bossier Parish, Louisiana. The net revenue interest of the lease is 75%. The W.T. Davis Well is located in the Arkana Field and initially produced from the Haynesville Formation of the Cotton Valley Series. With the worldwide focus on energy needs being front and center in the public eye, Emerson feels that with its first class management and discretionary project choices, the company will continue to serve its shareholders well.   *Emerson is Identifying additional step out opportunities on its Louisiana property.  *Emerson has signed a letter of intent to earn 50% working interest in the Rinsland well and Lease in Bossier Parish Louisiana.  *Emerson's North-West Louisiana drilling efforts follow closely to its philosophy of high-potential low risk re-entry projects in developed fields. By maintaining this conservative, but revenue driven philosophy and mission statement, Emerson enables itself to build a strong revenue base for the company and its shareholders, while taking the lowest possible risk in achieving this goal.

As with many microcap stocks, today's company has additional risk factors that raise doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Emerson Oil and Gas, Inc. is not a reporting company registered under the Securities Act of 1934 and hence there is limited public information available about the company. Other factors include: the company had no revenue in its most recent quarter and is not currently revenue producing.The company has a nominal cash position. The company is going to need financing to complete some business transactions and begin revenue producing. If that financing does not occur, the company may not be able to continue as a going concern in which case you could lose your entire investment.

However, weak market fundamentals, including a sluggish economy and increased  US and Canadian supplies, will mitigate the usual winter price rise. CERA  expects an average Henry Hub price of $2.35 in November.  *  Although inventories are close to record levels, storage pressures are  increasingly unlikely to drive cash markets down significantly this year.   *  Gas demand will average 14 percent lower than a year earlier; residential  and commercial sectors show a decline with a return to normal weather, while a  weak economy offsets the return of ammonia and dual-fuel loads in the  industrial sector.  *  Regional storage inventories and weak regional demand should keep upward  pressure off of regional differentials.

phishing,legitimate,True,"IN GOOD FAITH  Dear Friend,  Good day to you. I may have to trouble your sense of personal achievement and reward for an opportunity properly taken advantage of.  I am Mr. Michael Ramsey, a representative and attorney to Kenneth Lay, the former chairman & CEO, Enron Corp. Industry: Energy &Natural Resources Home, presently in jail and facing trial on charges of corruption and embezzlement of funds while in Power. He deposited ($21,000,000.00) with me when he was in power as the chairman.   I am contacting you because I want you to deal with the Finance house and claim the money on my behalf since I have declared that the Funds belong to my foreign business partner. You shall also be required to assist me in investment in your country. I hope to trust you as a God fearing person who will not sit on this money when you claim it, rather assist me properly, share in this percentage, 60% to me and 40% to you. When I receive your positive response I will give you viable information relating to this project i.e. the Finance institution where the money was deposited and the required documentation that will enable you lay claims to the funds, which is very important. What I need is for you to indicate your interest that you will assist us by receiving the money on my behalf in Europe. For this, you shall be considered to be the beneficiary to the funds. The project in brief, is that the funds with which we intend to carry out our proposed investments in your country, is presently in the custody of a bank in Europe. I do not want the government of my Country to know about the money because they will believe I got the money from the sales of Enron stock when he was the Chairman & C.E.O.of Enron   Once I have your details in full, the finance institution will contact you for Release of the funds to your account. As soon as payment is effected, and the amount mentioned above is successfully transferred into your account, I intend to use my own share in acquiring some estates abroad. For this too you shall also be the overseas manager of all our properties and you will be paid based on a certain percentage agreed on by both parties. I guarantee you that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Please get in touch with me urgently by E-mail:mr2001@faithmail.com. I am presently in LONDON.   Please, provide me the following: 1. Full Name 2. Your Telephone Number and Fax Number 3. Your Contact Address.   Best Regards.

legitimate,phishing,True,"RE: Enron's Advocacy in California Jim, We can talk at greater length if you want, but the quick answers to your questions are: 1. PX Credit: Make it simple and transparent.  Best outcome would be no credit -- DA pays T&D costs only, as they appear in the tariff.  Period, end of story. 2. The UDC Financial Hole: The more relief we can get from these items, the better.  Duh.  The small surcharge ($10) is currently factored into in our curves, so the hope is that whatever ultimately emerges from the sausage factory, the ultimate amount that they try to stick on DA customers is < $10.

Originally, CERA was planning to have a luncheon in December to discuss the  current status of these integrated contracts. Our intention was to invite key  individuals from Pemex to discuss the proposed contracts with our clients.  Pemex has informed us, however, that they are unable to discuss the service  contracts with the private sector prior to their formal announcement of the  service contract structure. Until this constraint has been resolved, CERA has  decided to have a conference call detailed below. We look forward to your  participation.   Regards,    Mexico Gas and Power  **************************************************************************  TOPICS  *  Overview of proposed service contract structure  *  Assessing the attractiveness of the contracts  *  Expectations of future investment under proposed structure  FORMAT  Our speakers will address this topic for 30 minutes, with accompanying graphics  presented on the Internet, followed by an open question and answer period.

legitimate,phishing,True,"ATTENTION & ACTION: UBS Warburg Energy Pilot Member  Welcome to the UBS Warburg Energy (UBSWE) Data Migration Pilot! We appreciate your acceptance of our request to be a member of the pilot and want to make you aware of some initial changes that will be in effect when you log into the new environment.  You will need to log off of your computer, and back in, to receive the changes that have been made.   When you logon to your computer, you will use your Enron NT account and password, you will immediately be prompted to change your password (following Enron ""password rules"")  Once you've changed your password and logged off again you will see the UBSWE splash screen which contains the legal disclaimer for using an UBSWE system (this is similar to the Enron splash screen).  What won't ""change""? Your desktop will look very much the same as it always has Your email will not be affected  What will ""change""? Your drive mappings to your home and common drives will have changed when you're in the new environment. This will be done automatically, but you should be aware of the following:  When you're in the new environment your H:\\ drive will contain some UBSWE data, but will not contain your personal data .... (don't worry!) you will find the contents of your Estate H:\\ drive in your UBSWE Z:\\ drive. When you are in the new environment your O:\\drive will contain some UBSWE data AND it will contain a directory named M:\\Estate and O:\\estate which contains links back to all of your M:\\and O:\\ drive data through the M:\\ and O:\\ Drive folders When you are in the new environment your P:\\ drive (new local common directory) will contain some USBWE data AND it will contain a directory named P:\\Estate which contains a link back to all of your legacy local common (i:\\ drive for Calgary users) data through the designated folders. When you are in the new environment you WILL have access to the applications that you use but these are UBSWE, but  you WILL NOT have access back to the Estate applications.  	 If you need access to the Estate applications, please contact your local IT support. They will have an ""est_"" account, with your legacy access rights. Please keep in mind that your ""est_"" account will only be valid until UBSWE Day 1, and you will have to request an extension of these rights should you need them beyond that date.  If you have any questions, please contact your local IT support team.  If you have specific questions regarding the pilot, please contact me at the numbers listed below.   Again, we appreciate your assistance in making the UBSWE transition a success!    Regards,  Dan Dietrich Office:	 713-345-8836 Mobile: 713-569-3651",0

legitimate,phishing,True,"[R] replicates in repeated ANOVA Hi,  I have sort of a newbie question. I've seriously put a lot of effort into how to handle simple replicates in a repeated ANOVA design, but haven't had much luck.  I really liked reading ""Notes on the use of R for psychology experiments and questionnaires"", by Jonathan Baron and Yuelin Li ( http://www.psych.upenn.edu/~baron/rpsych/rpsych.html ) but still didn't run across an example using simple replicates. So, I made up the data below semi-borrowing the idea of a reaction time experiment involving noise from Maxwell, S. E. & Delaney, H. D. (1990) Designing Experiments and Analyzing Data: A model comparison perspective. Pacific Grove, CA: Brooks/Cole., which was referenced in the Baron and Li link above. The experimental concept I'm trying to envision is 2 groups of subjects (Treat and Control), 3 subjects in each.  In one session, all 6 patients from both groups are tested for reaction time by making 3 replicate tests on some hypothetical RT test (I call this the ""pre"" testing phase below or one could call this baseline ).  In a second session (the ""post"" phase), the subjects in the ""Treat"" Group are subjected to noise (or any treatment), while the other 3 ""Control"" subjects are not, (i.e. the Control subjects are basically tested exactly like they were in the ""pre"" testing session). I'm trying to set up the correct model for this experimental design to simply understand whether ""noise"" (or treatment) has an effect on reaction time.  Can someone tell this newbie the proper name of this experimental design? By setting up the design this way, I'm hoping one could see if there was a ""pre"" session to ""post"" session effect (using the Control group) and then take into account any possible pre->post effect when deciding whether there was a Treatment (noise) effect.   Unfortunately, whenever, I put the Group factor in the Error term (to take into account subj:Group as a random effect), I get a singular result: (see the data entry section below)         > rt.aov <- aov(rt ~ Group*prepost + Error(subj/(prepost*Group)), data=rt.df)         Warning message:         Error() model is singular in: aov(rt ~ Group * prepost + Error(subj/(prepost * Group)), data = rt.df)  plus, I'm not sure how to include the replicate factor (""rep"") in my Error() term -- should it be something like  ...+Error(subj*rep/(Group*prepost))?             (this still gives the above error if Group is in the error term, but I'm pretty sure it should be there since all interactions given the individual subject are random effects, aren't they?) In my hypothetical experiment, I'm assuming the replicates are independent samples of reaction time -- although, admittedly, there could be a trend that should be looked for if one assumes that the subject ""gets better"" with each replicate. Suggestions on aov() model welcome!

Also, there is a vicious rumour going round that a year or so ago a rather large company in the UK lost a court case where an employee sent out some kind of libellous email or somesuch despite the company having implemented email disclaimers. pay no heed to this - its just a rumour (http://www.weblaw.co.uk/artemail.htm).Anyway, please: Email exel.com!!!> kevinNB: This email is copyright 2002 Paul Jakma.

This blew me away: in Barack's victory in Virginia last night, he won 142,000  more votes than all of the Republicans combined, and his victory margin over  Senator Clinton was larger than John McCain's entire vote total. All of this,  in what the Old Guard liked to pretend was ""red state"" Virginia.  When Barack and I rode together in the motorcade in Charleston, South Carolina  on the day I gave him my endorsement, we talked about the three-million-member- strong johnkerry.com community. We both agreed that this email list was a  community of supporters, not an ATM machine.  And so these last weeks, as I've talked with you, as Barack introduced himself  to you, as Ted Kennedy talked about Barack's commitment to health care for all,  and Gov. Tim Kaine talked about Barack's ability to unite our country -- we  haven't asked you to dig into your pockets.  We've asked you to get to know  Barack, to study his positions, to make phone calls to your neighbors, to go  door to door -- to get involved.  But today, I ask you to consider making a contribution as the campaign enters a  new phase. Wisconsin, Texas, Ohio, Pennsylvania -- the next big contests in  this campaign are big media market states, huge states that are expensive to  build statewide field organizations in, and Barack has a lot of ground to make  up. To win, Barack can use all of our help.  Click here to donate what you can: http://click.email.johnkerry.com/?ju=fe6216757361027d7511&ls=fdf715747c670c7977157370&m=fefd1273716607&l=fecd177070660c7d&s=fe2f167176660674721171&jb=ffcf14&t=    So there it is. I know not everyone here is an Obama supporter, and diversity  of opinion is a strength, not a weakness of our community -- but you've ""had my  back"" in so many fights these last years, I knew I could ask you to consider  signing up for another mission.  I have to tell you, this campaign has me excited. Excited, because I have seen  so much hope out there as I've traveled the country for Barack. Excited,  because as frustrated as I've been that the three words ""George W. Bush""  silenced any conversation at dinner tables around the country the last  eight years, I think we've found three words that will open a conversation  across the old divides, regardless of race, religion, gender, or income level -- and those three words are ""President Barack Obama"".  So please, click here to contribute what you can for Barack's campaign: http://click.email.johnkerry.com/?ju=fe6216757361027d7511&ls=fdf715747c670c7977157370&m=fefd1273716607&l=fecd177070660c7d&s=fe2f167176660674721171&jb=ffcf14&t=   I care about making this happen. I care about seeing Barack Obama win against  John McCain in a way that will break the Republican Roadblock in the Senate and  grow our progressive majority in the Congress.  Please dig deep -- I know we can do this.   This feels like the moment that got me and my generation to care about  politics -- and I want it to be the moment that millions more start to care for  the first time, or to care again, the way that you and I do now.

legitimate,phishing,True,"Bike Diary #6 Day 13 Date: Thursday July 5, 2001 Distance: 85 miles Moving average speed: 13.1 mph Left at: 8:00 AM Arrived at: 4:00 PM Overnight in: cyclist shelter in Monroeville, IN Latitude 40 d 58 m 7 s N Longitude 84 d 51 m 55 s W Cumulative distance: 1058 miles  Today I passed two major milestones: I crossed another state border (Ohio to Indiana, and yes, I took that picture of the sign), and I logged my 1000th mile.  Now it's easy to extrapolate forward: if I covered 1000 miles in 13 days then I should cover 4000 miles in 52 days, which is 7 weeks and 3 days, within the range of my 6-to-8 week predeparture prediction.  52 days from my starting date (June 23) is August 13.  I would estimate the error on that prediction to be +/- 4 days, on the grounds that I added 1 day of riding to the first 1000 miles to nurse an injured knee, which extrapolates to 4 days over 4000 miles.  The weather today was fine, sunny with a high in the 70s, and the riding conditions would have been perfect were it not for the damn headwind.  It was from the northwest this time, so I could get a  little component of it behind me every time my route turned a little bit south.  But along the stretches of roads aligned due west it was a real grind.  I should digress on the subject of that headwind.  If I could have a nickel for every time somebody has told me that I am riding the ""wrong way"" across the country because the prevailing winds blow from west to east, then I would start getting invited to Bill Gates' parties.  Generally speaking, my interlocutors do not even appreciate the full difficulty of riding from east to west, because not only are the prevailing winds against you, but so are the prevailing hills.  You may recall from a previous Bike Diary entry my discussion of why it is that one should always prefer to go gradually down hill as opposed to an exhilerating rapid descent that squanders all the energy gained from climbing into wind resistance (this is not my opinion, it is a fact of physics).  Well, if you think about it, Denver is a mile high (5000 feet above sea level), but still east of the Front Range of the Rockies.  The Mississippi River, on the other hand, is only a few hundred feet above sea level.  This is true everywhere as you approach the Rockies from the east (for example, Cut Bank, MT on my route is just short of 4000 feet elevation).  Therefore, going west across the great plains you are gradually climbing, only to rapidly descend again when you get across the continental divide. The eastbounders, on the other hand, get the benefit of playing out their altitude gain gradually over a long distance as they descend across the great plains.  So, why go west?  Personally, I feel that flying to the west coast and bicycling back is the moral equivalent of getting air lifted to the top of Everest, skiing down to the base camp and then claiming to have climbed the mountain.  It is as if you wanted the bragging rights to say you rode your bicycle across the country, but you wanted to obtain them with the least amount of exertion necessary.  If you live on the east coast, and you want to ride across the continent, it seems perfectly obvious to me that what you need to do is ride west.  One should not undertake such a project as this if you want to do something easy.  OK, end of tirade.  Just remember this the next time you meet someone who claims to have bicycled across the country: the westbounders are the real cyclists.  Speaking of westbounders, I may be closing in on some ahead of me. I stopped in at the bicycle store in Defiance, OH to see if they had any news of westbounders.  Apparently a couple, short in stature, had passed through four days ago.  I wonder if this is the same couple making a perimeter tour that I heard about from the scruffy eastbounder on route 20 in upstate NY (see Day 4, Bike Diary #2).  If so, they were 8-9 days ahead of me then and are only 4 days ahead of me now, so I may be closing the gap.  In 10 days I've gained 4 on them, with 4 more to go, so I would guess that I will probably catch up to them in another 10 days, around July 15.  Stay tuned.  I'm spending tonight in Monroeville, IN.  Monroeville is like the set of a Frank Capra movie: you have your supper in the Village Cafe (two fried pork chops with mashed potatoes and gravy and a side salad for six bucks) and a chocolate malted from the Whippy Dip for dessert. The clientele of the Whippy Dip is a small crowd of flirting teenagers, there's a little league baseball game going on the playing field in the city park, and after dark the fireflies come out in swarms. You may have thought that places like this didn't exist any more, but here in middle America civil small town life is alive and well. You don't lock up your bike and you don't worry about it, either.  My accomodation here in Monroeville is a pavillion in the city park that has been set up as a shelter specifically for long distance touring cyclists.  There's a small bathroom with every imaginable amenity from warm shower to washer/dryer for your laundry.  The hospitable residents of Monroeville expect nothing in return: you can leave a donation but there's no obligation.  There's a guest book where you can leave your name, starting point and destination, and from the list of names it appears that Monroeville is a popular destination for touring cyclists: there's a few coming through every couple of days. I scanned the list for evidence of westbounders ahead of me to no avail.  Day 14 Date: Friday July 6, 2001 Distance: 83 miles Moving average speed: 14.1 mph Left at 7:30 AM Arrived at 2:30 PM Overnight in Salamonie River State Forest near Wabash, IN Latitude 40 d 48 m 42 s N Longitude 85 d 41 m 53 s W Cumulative distance: 1141  Although I rode 83 miles today, I only advanced 56 along the route to Seattle.  There were two reasons for the extra 27 miles today, the first was an inadvertent detour first thing in the morning when I left Monroeville headed in the wrong direction.  Here's and important fact for you future trans-America cyclists to remember: the sun rises in the east and sets in the west.  Therefore, if you are navigating the midwestern grid on a sunny morning thinking that you are going west but you do not see your shadow in front of you, then something is terribly wrong. It took me about three or four miles to notice this discrepancy, miles which I had to double back, of course.  The second detour was up to Fort Wayne to pick up some mail that my friends Maria and Kate sent me (thanks Kate! thanks Maria!).  I love mail.  The rest of the day was full of county roads and cornfields in Indiana. The wind more or less behaved itself today, starting the morning from the southeast before settling back into its usual pattern of coming from the southwest.  It wasn't much of a wind in either direction, maybe 5-10 mph.  I could easily have made it a longer day, but there is a real scarcity of services along this particular stretch of the route.  The next campground is 38 miles farther on, and there isn't a motel in the next 87 miles.  I probably could have managed the 38 miles to the next campground, but in deference to my still aching knees I quit much earlier in the afternoon than I would normally.  It looks like I made an impressively early start today, but that turns out to be a bit of a trick.  Although most of Indiana is in the eastern time zone, the state does not observe daylight savings time (except for the part in the cental time zone, just for maximum confusion) so at this time of year I crossed into the central time zone for all practical purposes when I crossed the Indiana border.  My campground tonight is a ""primitive facility"" which translates to no shower and pit toilets.  Generally speaking, I don't much mind primitive campgrounds as they are generally alot emptier than the ones that cater to the RV crowd and provide full hookups (water and electrical).  This one is an exception to that rule: there's hardly a vacant site.  I suppose it must be because of the holiday weekend since there isn't anything terribly exciting to do in the neighborhood. Most of the other campers are sitting in their sites experimenting  with all the noise-making gear they have brought along (firecrackers, car stereos, bongo drums, you name it).  Oh well, after all these days on the road I think I could sleep through anything.  Day 15 Date: Saturday July 7, 2001 Distance: 86 miles Moving average speed: 12.1 mph Left at 9:30 AM Arrived at 6:15 PM Overnight in White House B&B in Rensselaer, IN Latitude 40 d 55 m 52 s N Longitude 87 d 9 m 6 s W Cumulative distance: 1227 miles  I awoke this morning at 5 AM (EST) to the sound of distant thunder.  At first, I didn't realize that it was thunder I was hearing.  I'm accustomed to thunder as an intermitent booming; the sound I hear this morning was a continuous background.  After I had ruled out military aircraft on manueovers as a possible source for the sound I heard, I realized that I was in big trouble.  My immediate thought was ""strike the tent and seek shelter"".  That probably seems strange to alot of people who figure that the tent IS shelter, but you may recall from my first night's experience that if the tent is pitched on a slope, then it provides precious little shelter from runoff soaking through the floor of the tent.  I had once again pitched the tent on a slope, not expecting rain.  In fact, it seemed that most of the folks in the campground were not expecting (or at least prepared for) the rain that came.  By 6 AM I had my gear stowed my gear and loaded on the bicycle, and I moved myself and the bicycle to the only shelter on the campground: a pavillion that protected, ironically enough, the campground's water supply. The water supply itself was nothing but a spigot, but it spilled into a catch basin that looked like it came out of a coroner's office: it was a shallow sink no wider than usual but long enough to lay down in.  The pavillion overhangs this sink by three or four feet on any side, therefore the entire sheltered area was no bigger than about eight by ten feet.  At 6:10 AM the rains came with a vengance.  I cannot remember the last time I saw such torrential rain and so much lightning.  I believe that more than four inches of rain fell during the next three and a half hours, with lightning hitting very close to where I was standing.  I now could under- stand why the distant thunder had been continuous, because I was now standing in the middle of it.  And there I stood, for about three and a half hours, making light conversation with some of the other campers who dared step out in the storm and waiting for it to end.  One guy seemed to have an unnaturally detailed knowledge of the roads and motels of Indiana; when I asked him what line of work he was in he said he was following power lines.  Apparently utilities hire these guys to go around the state following the power lines to make sure there are no trees nearby that threaten to fall on them.  At 9:30 AM it was clear that the worst of the storm had passed and I decided to head out and make the most of what was left of the day. I'm pretty much ready to get out of Indiana, having already spent more time crossing Ohio than I had hoped.  The day started out as a more or less routine one of grinding out miles across cornfields.  The wind was quite strong in the aftermath of the storm, but it had returned to its normal direction (southwest), so I concluded that the rain was probably over for the day.  The weather was hot and humid, and the pace pretty slow.  I ran into some eastbounders in Denver, IN.  I wouldn't have recognized them as tourists because they were travelling on unloaded bikes, but one of them stopped to talk to me.  They are a group of three men in their late 50s/early 60s doing the Northern Tier in sections while somebody's wife drives the camper/sag-wagon behind.  Boy, these guys have it easy: not only are they eastbound but supported as well!  And he had the nerve to complain to me about headwinds!  ""Take a look at that flag"" I said.  My goal for today after I realized that it would be abbreviated by rain was to make it to Rensselaer, IN.  I'm passing through a part of Indiana where the campgrounds are scarce (and so is the population), so I had to shoot for a town with a motel.  Upon, arriving in Rensselaer, I was greeted by a parade of hot-rods (in fact, some locals had stopped me about two miles from town to warn me that it was happening today). I would estimate that there was well over one hundred cars in the parade, and after it was over they proceeded to cruise the town revving engines and peeping tires much to the delight of the townsfolk, who had turned out to the last man to observe the spectacle.  I suppose this is some sort of July Forth weekend event that happens every year.  I ended up picking the B&B for the night since the only other option was a motel on the interstate.  It might have been cheaper, but I would really hate staying on an interstate strip four miles outside of town.  At least this way I could walk around town and watch the cars go by.  I think I was making slightly better time on foot than the cruisers were, but maybe that's their point.",0

But we don't really know exactly why Cho Seung-Hui went on a rampage on the campus of Virginia Tech. For our first story, correspondent Scott Pelley talks to Secret Service intelligence officers, whose exhaustive research into the minds of potential assassins and school shooters will provide valuable insights. Pelley is speaking with the officers today, April 20, and will report this story over the weekend, for what will perhaps be the freshest look yet at the mind of this mass killer.         This past week was also the deadliest in Baghdad - over 200 Iraqis were killed in a single day.  It has become a living hell for citizens of Baghdad just trying to get through an average day, as correspondent Lara Logan reports in our second story. How does one live in such a place? Very carefully, reports Logan, and often with the protection of a weapon, or in the case of Dr. Quoresh al-Kasir, the U.S. military. Nearly 200 doctors have been murdered in Iraq by insurgents intent on destroying Iraqi society. Soon after bullets began to crash through his windows, Dr. Quoresh heard a hopeful sound. ""We heard the helicopters starting to come to the area. My sons and daughter said, 'Oh, Baba, the Americans started to reach the area.'""     Watch  Logan's Reporter's Notebook.        The firing of Don Imus for uttering racially charged and misogynistic words black rap stars routinely use in their lyrics has shifted the spotlight to hip-hop culture and its dark messages.  As you'll see in our third piece, CNN's Anderson Cooper discovers that one of the rappers' popular messages, ""stop snitchin',"" does not help the police, but has actually confounded investigators' efforts to solve crimes, especially murder, and has now created some lawless neighborhoods.  Says Geoffrey Canada, educator and anti-violence advocate from New York City's Harlem neighborhood, ""It's like we're saying to the criminals, 'You can have our community....Do anything you want and we will either deal with it ourselves or we'll simply ignore it.'""     Watch  Cooper's Reporter's Notebook.        These stories, and Andy Rooney's love affair with books, this Sunday, April 22, on 60 Minutes at 7 p.m. ET/PT.

To fully leverage this new class of multi-core hardware, software developers must change the way they create applications. By turning their focus to multi-threaded applications, developers will be able to take full advantage of multi-core devices and deliver software that meets the demands of the world. But this paradigm of multi-threaded software development adds a new wrinkle of complexity for those who care the utmost about software quality.    Click Here to View This Whitepaper               Improving .NET Application Performance and Reliability with Managed Database Data Connectivity                Many .NET applications fail to meet user requirements because they do not provide optimal access to underlying Oracle, Sybase, or DB2 databases. The root cause is often unmanaged ADO.NET data providers shipped by the database vendor or from Microsoft. In this paper, SQL Server MVP and SSWUG co-founder Stephen Wynkoop explores common misperceptions about data access technologies, describes the optimum architecture for ADO.NET data providers, and highlights key selection criteria for developers.

You have to make sure your locale is set to ja_JP.UTF-8  and you need to  make sure that kinput2 is working properly. This will involve having  kinput2 and cannaserver both running.  Here is more information:  http://dspnet.fr/~lonewolf/LinuxJapan/Howto_English_Japanese.html  Make sure that the XMODIFIERS environment variable is set such as this  XMODIFIERS=""@im=kinput2""  Then you can test input first using notepad.  run ~/cxoffice/bin/wine  notepad then try inputing Japanese into notepad.  Then it should also work in MS  Office 2003.  thanks -aric   Gernot Hassenpflug wrote: > Hello all, >  > I have Debian GNU/linux unstable running with wine 0.9.54 and tried to > install MS Office 2003 under wine and using Crossover Office 6.0., but have > no figured out how to use the IME.

phishing,legitimate,True,"CONFIDENTIAL DR.TUNJI OWO Zenith Bank Ltd,Lagos,Nigeria, Private Tel:234-80-2354-6330.  Dear Friend, I am DR.TUNJI OWO.The Manager Zenith Bank, Lagos, Nigeria.  I have urgent and-ery confidential business proposition for you. On April 6, 1996, a Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr.Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for some months, valued at S$29,500,000.00 (Twenty Nine Million Five hundred Thousand Dollars only) in my branch. Upon maturity,I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month,we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers,the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Barry Kelly died on 1 February 1997 in a plane crash on air senegal on aircraft Name Hawker Siddeley HS-748. This crash happened in Tambacoumba, Senegal, Africa and the registration  number of the aircraft is 6AV-AEO, and since his untimely death the funds has been dormant in his account with my Bank without any claim of the fund On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$29,500,000.00 has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for safe-keeping.No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law,at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as an Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money I deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes though the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as I tagged them to be photographic materials for export.   am writing you because I as a public servant, we can not operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than $1m.I want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney.All these are to make sure that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney willprepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the as the owner of the boxes. The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 25% for you and 5% will take care of all expenses.There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantee the successful execution of this transaction. f you are interested, please reply immediately via my email address. upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe with utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. REGARDS. DR.TUNJI OWO.",1

""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stret! ch! . Trent Dilfer , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point. Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 10/23/01 Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck fr! om! a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week. Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 10/23/01 The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams. Dedric Ward , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season. Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Neal/McKay Updated 10/23/01 Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week. Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week. Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Tori U! pd! ated 10/23/01 Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use him this week. Terrence Wilkins , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week. Terrell Davis , RB DEN - JWillie Updated 10/23/01 Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they will activate h! im! . He will work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Martin Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice until late in the week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota.  Duce Staley , RB PHI - Giggles Updated 10/23/01 Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on 11 carries l! at! e in the game. At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a solid replacement.  Joe Nedney , K TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week.  Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Kinney will be listed on the injury report because of a calf injury. However, he is expected to play in this week's game.  Kevin Dyson , WR TEN - Bass/Hull Updated 10/23/01 Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice. Eddie George , RB TEN - Tori Updated 10/23/01 George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in this week's game.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Martin Updated 10/23/01 McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game.  Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence.  Damon Jones , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery.  Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Martin Updated 10/23/01 Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's game remains uncertain. ""All I know is that, from week to week, they increase his exercises and change of direction,"" head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. ""It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week."" Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23.  Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to action next week.  Todd Heap , TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle.  Terry Allen , RB BAL - Tori Updated 10/23/01 Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at running back if Allen is inactive.  Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Tori Updated 10/23/01 Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. ""I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest area,"" Grbac said Monday. ""There could be something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see."" Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unable to play.  Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Neal/McKay Updated 10/23/01 Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orleans.  Trung Canidate , RB STL - Giggles Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. ""I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game,"" coach Mike Martz said. ""He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play."" Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week.  J.J. Stokes , WR SF - Matty Updated 10/23/01 Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close to being completely healthy. ""Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was a blessing for me because I was ab! le! to get treatment every day,"" Stokes told the Contra Costa Times . ""I practiced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close."" Stokes has been less than mediocre, however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to be more reliable.  Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - Russell Updated 10/23/01 Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants' starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed.  Ron Dixon , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day.  Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Matty Updated 10/23/01 According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. ""I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago,"" Martz said. ""I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play."" Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to go.

This letter is a piece of advice by IPN (Internet Pharmacy Network)  officially registered organization dealing with the problem of mass drug falsification. There are so many online drugstores on the Web today  but not all of them are as reliable as one might want them to be. Actually, only a few of them (for example, USDrugs) sell 100% generic meds  so you have to be really careful while choosing where to buy your pills. Hope that you take our advice seriously. Take care.Please click here for more information. With Best Regards,  Bradford Delong USDrugs B.V. http://rpifjw.balechony.info/?dklbetmqtbet",1

legitimate,phishing,True,"[sugar] Fwd: OLPC Nepal looking for Volunteers for this Summer ---------- Forwarded message ---------- From: Bryan Berry  Date: May 3, 2007 6:54 AM Subject: OLPC Nepal looking for Volunteers for this Summer To: devel@laptop.org, games@laptop.org, olpc-open@laptop.org   from: http://olpcnepal.blogspot.com/2007/05/were-looking-for-volunteers-for-this.html  As you may read in the previous Post "" An Amazing Educator,"" a fantastic educator has joined our group. We are looking to work with her very intensely this summer to implement many of her existing learning activities and add as many cool activities as we can. In the fall we plan to visit many, many schools to figure out how kids and teachers react to these materials.  Right now we have three full-time volunteer developers, all of them Nepali. We would love four (4) foreign volunteers to come work with us this summer in Kathmandu. We will pair each foreign volunteer with a Nepali intern. That should bring our content strike force to 11 people. That would really help us to advance OLPC in Nepal.  Requirements: We are looking for experienced programmers. Your age and # of university degrees are less important to us than your passion for software development. We seek individuals with significant software development experience on Linux, ideally in Python, PyGames, C, etc. You should have already run the OLPC image in an emulator.  You should expect to stay in Nepal for a minimum of 6 weeks. You can stay a maximum of 5 months due to Nepal's complex visa rules. If your application is selected, you can start as soon as you can get here.  Compensation: We are prepared to offer a generous salary package of $0 per month, reimburse you for a full 0% of your airplane ticket cost, and offer no health plan. We don't have any $ :) Our office, bandwidth, and computers have all been donated. We can offer comfortable lodging for a total of four volunteers. We can accept additional volunteers if they are willing to find and pay for their own accommodation.  We can offer you an opportunity to work w/ a very passionate team of engineers on one of the most exciting projects in the world. If you are interested please send an e-mail with your C.V. and a brief description of what you have done w/ OLPC so far to bryan at olpcnepal dot org  Unfortunately, summer is monsoon season so Nepal aweseome trekking isn't a good idea. Still, it's been a weird year weather-wise. We'll try to get you out for a trek near the end of the summer.  We'll take you running/hiking in the hills surrounding Kathmandu if you are so inclined and subject you to Ankur's bad jokes (and they are very bad).  The Work: You will work closely with our lead developers Shankar, Ankur, and Himali Kiran and our lead educator Christine Stone. You will help implement a series of activities based on PyGame and/or GCompris. That means writing a lot of Python, possibly some C, working with sound libraries, and more. If you have some exciting ideas for power management or mesh networking, we may find some time to work on them w/ you. However, you should expect to spend most of your time building Sugar activities, getting feedback from Christine, revising, showing to kids and teachers, repeat.  We will expect you to train the Nepali intern assigned to you. The intern will most likely be an undergraduate computer science student.  The development team will frequently interact with kids and teachers over the course of the summer.  We intend to recruit education volunteers at a later date. I'll save that for a future blog entry.  --  Bryan W.

I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim we may make like the Certificate of Deposit and Copy of Agreement issued to my client on the date of deposit, I also have a copy of the death Certificate of my client. All I require is your honest cooperation and maximum secrecy to enable us see this deal through.   I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.

However, weak market fundamentals, including a sluggish economy and increased  US and Canadian supplies, will mitigate the usual winter price rise. CERA  expects an average Henry Hub price of $2.35 in November.  *  Although inventories are close to record levels, storage pressures are  increasingly unlikely to drive cash markets down significantly this year.   *  Gas demand will average 14 percent lower than a year earlier; residential  and commercial sectors show a decline with a return to normal weather, while a  weak economy offsets the return of ammonia and dual-fuel loads in the  industrial sector.  *  Regional storage inventories and weak regional demand should keep upward  pressure off of regional differentials.

legitimate,phishing,True,"Assessing the post September 11 Landscape: CERA's New Global Energy Initiative Assessing the post September 11 Landscape: CERA's New Global Energy Initiative  The uncertainties created by the attack on September 11 and the global response have created turmoil for near-term energy planning and investment decision making. Circumstances demand rapid reassessments of near-term risks and strategies. In response to client requests, CERA is undertaking a comprehensive, new initiative to develop a framework for understanding potential energy futures and their implications.  This special multiclient project will include interactive analyses, face-to-face workshops, and real-time updates. It will draw on CERA's broad industry and regional expertise, offering participants both a framework and a robust tool for evaluating strategies across all sectors of the energy business and all geographies. The focus will be on creating new and highly relevant insights into the energy future and the political and economic context. It will highlight both key trends and probable discontinuities -- and assess urgent issues in a setting that will promote thoughtful and informed dialogue.  By emphasizing both virtual and in-person exchanges among participating members and CERA experts, we will establish a three-year road map for decision makers across the energy business, to complement CERA's industry-specific and shorter-term analyses. In addition, the process will offer a unique opportunity to interact with others across the energy spectrum and to share ideas and experiences.  * Could the economic slowdown be prolonged and inflation be rekindled? * What is the impact on energy demand -- does the fuel mix shift? * How great are the risks for disruptions of supply? In which countries and for which fuels? * How would disruptions play out?  And how tumultuous will they be for energy companies? * How will energy policies change -- relative to energy security, environmental trade-offs, and fuel strategies? * Will the global coalition hold, or are we moving to a more divided and more fractured world? * How profound will be the changes for the energy business?  This timely series provides a three-year horizon that draws on the framework established in CERA's longer-term scenarios. It uses the clash between the ""Fragmentation"" and ""Globality"" scenarios as the starting point for assessing the new world in which energy-decision makers will operate and the critical choices they will face.  The first workshop will be held in Houston on November 15, in conjunction with CERA's Fall Roundtable series.  Additional workshops, both in Houston and other cities and via online technologies, will follow. We will announce the entire schedule, with events and deliverables, soon. The process will deliver a clear framework for anticipating the future, and conclusions for energy strategy.

legitimate,phishing,True,"You Did a Good Job Dear Mr. Lay:  In this trying time of second-guesses and angry shareholders, I wanted to let you know that I have appreciated working for you and share a quick story of how you shaped my view of Enron and the corporate world in general.  My second rotation as an associate was to write speeches for the Office of the Chairman.  Generally, I was creating presentations for Jeff Skilling, but I did create a couple for you as well.  The one I remember best was for the speech at Astro Hall for the Houston Energy Conference where we announced Enron Online.  Not only did you let me lead the internal roundtable (I remember sitting at the table, trying to keep my composure as Greg Whalley, Dan Leff, Louise Kitchen and others asked specifics about the slides I created), but you also (generally) agreed with my answers and thanked me for a job well done.  That night, I shared a bottle of champagne with my wife and truly believed I could do anything!!  So, as far as I am concerned, you have done a tremendous job.  Everything happening now is unfortunate.  It happened on your watch and thus is partly your responsibility.  But you have stepped up to the plate, most likely saved more jobs than lost, and been accountable in more ways than one.  Being a leader in good times and in bad, and more importantly affecting the lives of your employees on a personal basis, are truly attributes that I hope to continue in my lifetime.  I just wanted you to know that you have truly made a difference in one man's career.  And I feel all the better for it.  My prayers go to you and your family.

The paper is available on the Publications page of my website, www.EHirst.com << File: http://www.ehirst.com/ >> . Please let me know if you have any comments on the paper. Here is a summary of the paper:         California was supposed to show the rest of the nation a brighter electricity future. That future, as outlined by the California Public Utilities Commission in 1994, envisioned an electricity industry featuring competitive markets. Such markets were intended to produce lower costs and more choices for consumers, while ensuring profits for efficient energy suppliers and encouraging the retirement of old, inefficient power plants.         Although the first two years of restructuring (beginning in April 1998) seemed to bear out these promises, the last year has been a disaster for California's electricity consumers, taxpayers, and electric utilities. Part of the fallout from California's electricity crisis is considerable concern-even opposition-in other states to restructuring the electricity industry.          Although a few states have decided, based on the California experience, not to restructure, I believe that is the wrong outcome. Instead, the primary lessons other states should learn from California are that competitive markets can work; competition is not to blame for California's problems; and basic economic principles of supply, demand, and prices affect market outcomes.         Section 2 of this paper briefly reviews the history of electricity regulation and restructuring in California and the problems that occurred beginning in May 2000. Section 3, the heart of this paper, offers guidance to other states on the key ingredients of a competitive electricity industry. This section makes several points:   Maintain a favorable investment and regulatory climate for new generation to ensure that enough generation capacity is online and planned to meet growing loads.   Ensure that enough infrastructure (transmission capacity and natural gas pipeline capacity) is in place and planned to meet growing loads, maintain reliability, connect new generators to the grid, support large regional markets, and provide fuel to power plants.   Encourage retail customers to participate in dynamic-pricing and voluntary-load-reduction programs (i.e., couple retail and wholesale markets).   Create honest retail competition: avoid standard-offer rates with artificial discounts and create conditions that encourage many companies to offer retail services without favoring individual competitors.   Encourage electricity suppliers to manage and diversify their supply and price risks.   Create efficient and integrated wholesale markets for energy, ancillary services, and transmission congestion.   Monitor and minimize horizontal market power (generation) and vertical market power (combined ownership and operation of generation and transmission).           Ultimately, competitive markets for electricity will lower costs and prices, better align consumer prices with producer costs, improve producer efficiency in both investment and operation, maintain or improve reliability, and yield greater innovation in customer services and pricing options.          But, this transition from one industry structure to another is turning out to be long and complicated. It is complicated because electricity is so important to our modern, high-tech society; electricity is our most flexible fuel, providing light, heat, motive power, and the energy to operate all our electronic equipment. Also, electricity truly is a real-time product for which production and consumption must occur at the same time.          Although the problems that have occurred in California are substantial and worrisome, regulators and legislators in other states should focus on the long-term benefits of competitive electricity markets and accept the possible short-term problems that may occur. They also need to recognize that wholesale markets are regional in scope and extend far beyond the boundaries of any single state. Finally, competition in retail and wholesale markets must be coordinated; in particular, it is not possible to have competitive wholesale markets unless at least some retail load faces time varying prices.          If states restructure properly to create competitive markets for wholesale energy and retail services, we should all benefit. Consumers will enjoy lower prices, they will have many more choices of energy services and price-risk tradeoffs, reliability will be improved because most reliability services will be obtained through markets instead of by engineering edict, and the financial risks associated with building and operating power plants will be assigned properly to investors rather than consumers.

However, weak market fundamentals, including a sluggish economy and increased  US and Canadian supplies, will mitigate the usual winter price rise. CERA  expects an average Henry Hub price of $2.35 in November.  *  Although inventories are close to record levels, storage pressures are  increasingly unlikely to drive cash markets down significantly this year.   *  Gas demand will average 14 percent lower than a year earlier; residential  and commercial sectors show a decline with a return to normal weather, while a  weak economy offsets the return of ammonia and dual-fuel loads in the  industrial sector.  *  Regional storage inventories and weak regional demand should keep upward  pressure off of regional differentials.

phishing,legitimate,True,"(Peace) Dear Sir/Madam  At this perceived confusion or stress may have With due respect. Sorry receiving this letter Since we have not known ourselves or met before.  Despite that, I am constrained to write you this letter because of the urgency of it.   By way of self introduction, I am Mrs Joy Afolabi, the wife of late Dr. Sunday Afolabi Little did I know that my Late husband used his position in the present government to influence the  Nigerian government to award SAGEM S.A COMPANY (FRANCE)  the contract of handing the Nigerian national identification card scheme in Nigeria of, which he and his colleagues were then offered the sum of $214 million dollars by SAGEM as bribes.  Since my husband was a care-free person, he was poisoned by his colleagues so that he will not get his share of the deal and later died out of shock during his treatment abroad in Germany when he Finlay realised that his case was as a result of poison, but thank God, my husband was smart enough to have kept some wealth without letting anybody knows about it.   However, since after my husband death, we have suffered maltreatment and untold hardship in the hands of my late husband's family, simply because I did not bear a male child [heir apparent] for my late husband. By tradition, all that my late husband had, [wealth] belongs to his brothers/family. And myself is to be remarried by his immediate younger brother which I vehemently refused. They have taken all that I suffered with my husband to acquire including treasures, houses and his bank particular seized by them. I wanted to escape to the United States of America [USA} with my children on exile, but again they conspired and stole my International passport and  other travelling document to further frustrate me. My three daughters and I are trapped in obnoxious custom and traditional norms.   Thank God, two weeks ago, I received Key Text Code from a Security Company in EUROPE, that my late husband deposited U.S $15.5 Million cash in one Security company in Europe. It has therefore become very necessary and urgent to contact someone a foreigner like you to help me receive/secure these funds overseas in a  reliable bank Account presumably an empty Bank Account, if available and  to help invest it on our behalf as well, while we find a way of getting out to meet with you in your country. These funds are kept with one Security Company in EUROPE to avoid detection, seizure or diversion.   I have had several communication with  the Director of the security company in Europe, who has express willingness to help me on meeting the company's demands.  This is why I have contacted you to help save my children and I By receiving these funds on our behalf. But you need to give me Sufficient assurance that you will not divert the fund if you help me.    My children and I have resolved to give you 30% of the total sum. This is all my children and I have got to live on.    Please, I have reposed my confidence in you and hope you will not disappoint me. I look forward to your urgent response, including your phone/ mobile No and also your fax no for easier communication. The secret codes (e.g Pin No, Secret Access Code)for this fund are safely kept with me which I can give you as soon as you express desire to help me.  Thank in advance for confidentiality and I look forward to hearing from you.  Mrs. Joy Afolabi.

phishing,legitimate,True,"We can do this  Dear Sir,      I am DR KABO HAMMED     I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, an American oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) deposited for twelve calendar months, valued at US$41,500,000.00 (Forty-one Million, five hundred Thousand Dollars) in my branch upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract  employers, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident  with his family along Benin/Shagamu Express Way. On  further investigation, I found out that he did not  leave a WILL and allattempts to trace his next of kin  were fruitless.      I therefore made further investigation and discovered  that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any next of kin n all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork. This sum of US$41,500,000.00 is still sitting in the Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will come forward to claim it.  According to the Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.      Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Barry Kelly so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide me immediately with your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents  and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin.   We shall employ the services of two attorneys for drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world, which you provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you.      There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via email.

legitimate,phishing,True,"Lindows.com: Michael's Minute: Lindows.com Report Card ------=_LINDOWS_1890362a5620f32f969ae58b8fe2ef84 Content-Type: text/plain; 	charset=""us-ascii"" Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit If this message is not displaying properly, click  here to launch it in your browser.   Michael's Minute:  Lindows.com Report Card  As summer arrives, many school children are coming home with their report cards.  I thought this would be a good time to see what kind of grades Lindows.com received for their first 9 months in operation..   To view the Timeline of Lindows.com's first 9 months in business, click here  .  Operating System:   As of last week, consumers can experience LindowsOS in one of two ways. One way is to buy a computer running LindowsOS from Walmart.com  , for as little as $299. This is a significant milestone for us, as we've partnered with our first builder (Microtel) and retailer (Walmart). These computers work great out of the box and are ideal for general purpose computing tasks.  For those who already have a computer and also wish to try LindowsOS, we offer the Insider program  . This gives people wanting early access to LindowsOS a chance to try out LindowsOS as it develops. Currently, Insiders report installation success about 80%  of the time on their PCs. Therefore we have some room to grow, consequently, this product is not yet for everyone.  Some may wonder how we can sell a computer at Walmart  when the program available directly from Lindows.com is billed as not completely ready. The difference is the Walmart   computers are certified, ensuring that all components  work elegantly with LindowsOS. That's much different than offering a software program that will work on any computer in the world - that's very difficult. It's the difference between making a single pair of shoes for a known foot size versus opening a shoe store with every style of shoe for every size foot. The first one is easy, the second one is a much bigger job. While the installer is fantastically easy and fast (the entire OS installs in under 5 minutes), we've got a lot more work to do to support a wider range of hardware, printers and other devices. Grade:  B   _____   Software:  Our goal to give people choice means giving them choice not just on their operating system, but access to all the programs they'll want to add to their computer to really make it work for them in their school, home or business. Click-N-Run   is the easiest way to load software onto a computer. For the first time a Linux based system has leapt ahead of Microsoft's operating systems in ease of use. With 1,000 plus programs already in the Click-N-Run Warehouse  , users can find quality software titles for just about any computing task and, with a single mouse-click download, install and run these programs. All these titles are included in the $99. This is a fantastic consumer experience and price point. Look for a lot more great software in the Warehouse in the future. Grade: A-   _____   Microsoft Windows Compatibility: We live in a Microsoft world, so there needs to be a bridge from the legacy world to the broadband LindowsOS world. This means we need to support some bridge programs, file types and network devices to help people interact with the legacy Microsoft world. LindowsOS computers come with software to view, print and copy popular Microsoft applications like: MS Word files, MS PowerPoint files and MS Excel documents. There's great Linux based alternatives and we'll guide people to those alternatives (they're better than most people realize). To edit Microsoft files, we'd highly recommend one of the office suites in our Warehouse such as OpenOffice  .  Many of these programs are of very high-quality and a great value since they're included in the Warehouse  . Sometimes there are no viable alternatives for those programs, so we're investing necessary resources to support some Microsoft Windows based programs. Stay tuned for more developments in this area. Our printer support is ok, but there's lots of room for more drivers. Connecting to MS Windows based file servers is still a challenge. We need to get better in the above areas.  Grade: B    _____   Communication: We've tried to be diligent in communicating where our company is going which is why there's typically a weekly Michael's Minute  . While our overall goal has not deviated - Bringing Choice To Your Computer - our implementation has become more focused as we listened to what our Insiders and potential customers have told us. (Keep sending me your comments.) We have been de-emphasizing running Microsoft Windows programs because many of you told us you detest spending hundreds of dollars on individual software programs, forced upgrades and activation codes. It's not just the operating system, but costly Microsoft programs you're wanting to avoid.  Consequently, we've been emphasizing Click-N-Run because it will change the way you think about software. Having a neatly categorized library   of 1,000+ software titles all for a flat annual fee at your digital fingertips is an entirely new way to think about paying for software. It's immediate, elegant and affordable. There are lots of mischaracterizations about Lindows.com swirling around - which happens when you have a small organization which can't address every question or publication. We'll do a better job of addressing these in the future. For now, I wrote up answers to the Top Myths about Lindows.com. Check them out by visiting: www.lindows.com/myths  Grade: B+   _____   Overall: B+ Michael Robertson Please visit support.lindows.com   to answer questions you may have about LindowsOS or Lindows.com. Bringing Choice to Your Computer!    LindowsOS is presently available on LindowsOS Certified Computers being offered from Lindows.com   Builder partners.  The General Release of LindowsOS (available now for download and preview to Lindows.com   Insider partners) will be made available later this year for those wishing to install and run LindowsOS on their existing computer hardware.  The General Release version will support a wider range of computer hardware and includes unique features such as a ""Friendly-Install"" alongside an existing MicrosoftR Windows operating system, a streamlined installation process which requires no computer knowledge, and the ability to run a select set of ""bridge"" Windows-compatible programs.
