legitimate,phishing,True,"Cabot Wealth Advisiory 7/5/07 - TV, Intelligence and More July 5, 2007  Salem, Massachusetts  By Timothy Lutts  -----  There's Nothing On!  The SAT Measures What?  A Company With Predictive Decisioning Software  -----  My wife recently attended a conference in upstate New York and one night found herself back in her hotel room, turning to the television for entertainment.  Now, in our family, real-time network television is a rare event.    Thanks to Replay TV, a one-time competitor of TiVo in the DVR (digital video recorder) business, our favorite shows get recorded on a big hard disk and we watch them when we want, skipping the commercials as we go.  In fact, the only time we watch commercials is during the Super Bowl.  More often, we read.  In any event, there was my wife, in a New York state hotel room, ""forced"" to choose from a dreadful selection of real-time network TV offerings.  Of course she could have turned it off, but in that dull hotel room in that strange town, she was just searching for a little life, a little humor, a little intelligence.  What she got was bad TV, along with an onslaught of repetitive, often-insulting commercials.  So she called me, and somewhere along the way she asked, ""Why do people watch this garbage?  And why do the networks play the same commercials, sometimes several times during the same show?""  I couldn't give her an easy answer, but I did sympathize, and that's really what she wanted.  Soon after, I googled ""top ten TV shows,"" and here's what I found.  America's Got Talent Dateline NBC Deal or No Deal Law and Order N-C-I-S C-S-I Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader? Two and A Half Men So You Think You Can Dance? C-S-I Miami  I've never seen any of these, which goes to show you how out of touch I am.  But I do know (from reading) that four of them are crime dramas, two are talent searches, two are game shows, one is a sitcom and one is a news magazine that typically focuses on human-interest stories.  Reviewing this list, I'm reminded of the words of HL Mencken, who wrote, ""No one in this world, so far as I know, has ever lost money by underestimating the intelligence of the great masses of the plain people.""  Then, a few days ago one of my editors commented to me, no doubt after viewing one of the those headlines like ""Man Shoots Self in Groin While Attempting To Make Ham Sandwich,"" ""You know, half of Americans are of below average intelligence.""  Upon reflection, it's obvious.  And it's statistically inevitable.    The average is near the middle, so half will always be below the average (technically, below the median, but given the very large numbers we're dealing with, there's little difference.)  And if you don't know the difference between mean and median, you probably haven't crammed for an SAT test lately.  The converse, however, does not mean that if you do know the difference you have crammed for the test recently.  That's logic at work.  And the SAT, now that I've brought it up, is not what it used to be.  In 1901 it debuted as the Scholastic Achievement Test, supposedly measuring what students had learned.  In 1941, the name was changed to Scholastic Aptitude Test, supposedly measuring what students were capable of learning, if they had the proper socio-economic advantages.  In 1990, that was changed to Scholastic Assessment Test, supposedly measuring . . . something scholastic?  And in 1994 the name was changed to SAT (the letters officially standing for nothing at all!)  Finally (or, should I say, most recently, because I suspect there are more changes around the corner), in 2005 the name was changed to SAT Reasoning Test, creating a potential redundancy of the word ""Test"" but only if the first T still stood for Test, which it doesn't.  Reasoning, of course, includes logic, and I like that a lot. I hope they keep that name for a while.  Now, I took the SAT a few decades back.  Two of my kids have taken it and the third is likely to in a couple years.  But something else has changed over the decades besides the name.  In 1995 the yardstick for scoring was adjusted to account for the growing number of kids from less rigorous schools taking the test.  The reason?  The big bulge in the middle of the distribution curve, which had previously been centered at 400, had slipped down into the mid-300s.  To get the mid-point back up, the average verbal score was artificially increased by some 70 points while the average math score had 20-30 points added.  The kids at the top and bottom were barely affected, but the masses of average kids near the middle saw their scores bumped up dramatically.  What does it matter?  Well, a good score helps you get into college.    But is there a correlation between success on the SAT and success in college?  Looking further out, is there correlation between success on the SAT and success in life?  The simple answer is, some, but not a lot.  And more and more colleges are recognizing that; the number of colleges that admit students without regard to test scores now exceeds 400.  But the SAT lives on, and will continue to be here for years to come.  Why?  In part because it's the product of The College Board.    The College Board is a non-profit organization, and while there's no doubt that it works hard to serve the high schools and colleges and families that use it, there's even less doubt - in my mind - that the organization works even harder to ensure its own survival.   ----- ADVERTISEMENT -----  Join Cabot Stock of The Month and get in on the next stock that explodes like these...   * Broadvision-up 670%  * Intuitive Surgical-up 500%  * Yahoo-up 317%  * Amazon.com-up 1,290%  * First Marblehead-up 50%  * International Game Technology-up 110%  * eResearch Technology-up 180%  * NetEase-up 100%  * Expedia-up 114%  * Broadcom-up 97%  * Netflix-up 173%  * Psychiatric Solutions-up 85%  * PetroKazakhstan-up 86%  * Nautilus-up 109%  That's the beauty of Cabot Stock of the Month.

""A financial services firm in Japan has begun offering lower mortgage interest rates to ""intelligent"" customers.  GE Consumer Finance Company is giving discounts to people who have good English or computer skills, and work in ""high-value"" areas such as the law.  The company says more highly skilled workers usually find it easier than others to get jobs and to keep them. They are therefore less likely to become insolvent and default on their home loan.  GE Consumer Finance Company claims this is the first time that mortgage rates have been calculated like this in Japan.  People who have high scores on a test of English proficiency and officially certified IT skills can apply for a small discount.  Those of them who also have certain jobs - such as lawyers, accountants, doctors and financial experts - can obtain further discounts.  If a couple are both employed in the 20 ""high-value"" professions listed by the company, they will be entitled to a major rate reduction.""  It makes sense, and I'm guessing it's illegal to discriminate that way in the U.S.  -----  Getting back to TV, the problem is not just the quality of programming but the quantity of time people spend viewing.  The TV is on for over 7 hours in the average American home, and the average American watches over 4 hours of TV per day.  Worse still, the average American child watches 1,023 hours of TV a year and spends 900 hours in school.  And one thing they're seeing in those hours is commercials.  For broadcast TV, commercials pay the bills, and the advertisers are doing all they can to ensure that the message from those commercials reaches your brain.  But more and more these days, people are working to avoid those commercials by fast-forwarding through them using DVRs.  So NBC recently tested people to see if those commercials had any impact at high-speed.  NBC, you know, wants its advertisers' money even if viewers are watching at fast speeds.  The result, according to a story three days ago in The New York Times, ""judging from the biological reactions, the test subjects were just as engaged while watching fast-forwarded advertisements as they were while viewing opening scenes from the NBC show ""Heroes"" at regular speed.""  When it comes to fast-forward advertisements, ""the assumption has always been that they have no economic value, that they have no communication value,"" said Alan Wurtzel, president for research at NBC Universal. ""But the fact of the matter is we're learning that they are valuable.""  And they're so ""valuable"" to the financial health of the TV industry that the commercial-skipping DVR that I bought years ago can no longer be bought!  But the problem is not just the commercials.  The problem is that every minute spent watching TV is a minute not being used to reflect, to do something productive, or to interact with other family members.  And the result of all this TV viewing, according to a recent study by the Culture and Media Institute, is that ""increased exposure to television correlates with a decline in acceptance of personal responsibility.""  Now, it's important to note that the word correlate was used there.    Officially, there's no established causality.  But my sense is that our country has seen a marked decrease in a sense of personal responsibility; that too many people all too easily blame others for their troubles.  And when personal responsibility shrinks, we get a culture that thinks it's okay to act stupid because somebody else will pick up the tab.  ----- Contest -----  Now, there is an investment idea coming here, but first I want to give a reward to a loyal reader who has chosen to read this far.

Do it now.  -----  And now, finally, here we are at today's stock.  It's about intelligence and it's about marketing, and if you understand how important marketing is to the world, you may like this one enough to invest in it.  You know and I know that at every turn, companies are doing their darndest to sell us things.  At Amazon they know what I've bought before and thus know what to sell me next.  And at Netflix they know what movies I've rated highly so they can suggest other movies they think I'd enjoy.  Those two firms have developed specialized software that serves their individual needs, but for most companies, there's off-the-shelf software that works very well, and a lot of it is coming from a company named Chordiant.  Here's what we wrote in a recent issue of Cabot Top Ten Report.  ""Chordiant (CHRD) makes customer service and marketing software that helps big companies deal with their customers, so that the goals of both the merchant and the customer are met. Customers include 21st Century Insurance, Bank of Ireland, Banque Populaire, Barclays, Capital One, Covad Communications, Cox Communications, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Lloyds, MetLife, Nokia, Prudential, Royal Bank of Scotland, Royal Dutch Shell, Time Warner Cable, T-Mobile, UPS and Wachovia. These are huge blue-chip companies, yet Chordiant is still a small company, and growing fast. Historically, the company has had trouble making a profit (its last profitable year was 2004), but after the first quarter's terrific results, CEO Steven R. Springsteel commented that solid profitability was ""due to the strong performance in our international business, the acceleration of percentage of completion project implementations in Europe, and greater enablement of our partners resulting in fewer Chordiant resources being required on some project implementations."" It sounds good to us. Since then the company has been awarded a patent for ""advanced predictive decisioning technology."" In other words, the companies using this software sometimes know what you're going to buy before you do! As companies come to depend on this software, Chordiant's future is likely to be consistently profitable, and the realization of that is why the stock is strong today.""  Digging deeper, I see that Chordiant has been growing revenues since 2003, and in the latest quarter saw revenues grow 25% from the year before to $32.8 million, while earnings jumped from a penny per share to $0.18 per share.  Analysts are projecting a profit of $0.48 per share this year and $0.72 per share next year.  And the after-tax profit margin was a fat 19.6%.  Trading at 16, it's rather low-priced and thus carries the extra risk of volatility that comes from stocks at this level.   But average trading volume is nearly 500,000 shares per day, and institutional interest is growing.  I'd like it better on a dip to 15, but if it doesn't dip there in the week ahead, 16 may be the best price you'll get.  -----  Editor's note:  To get regular updates on Chordiant, and to get first notice of other hot stocks, consider a no-risk trial subscription to Cabot Top Ten Report.

phishing,legitimate,True,"URGENT ASSISTANCE PARAMOUNT SECURITY COMPANY HOLLAND, LAGOS BRANCH. Private Email:{femimartins876@fsmail.net  Dear Friend, I am Mr.femimartins,Manager of paramount security company, Lagos Branch. I apologize for using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that your enviable credentials/particulars were given to me by a member of the South African Export Promotion Council who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as confidential because of the nature of this transaction . I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On Dec. 19, 1998, a Canadian Oil consultant/contractor with the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, Mr. Antoine Blanc made a numbered timed(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty Five Million Dollars)in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Ministry of Energy and Natural resources that Mr. Antoine Blanc died from a plane crash. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a Will, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was futile. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Antoine Blanc did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my security company. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my security company and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 6 (six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as an Foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Antoine Blanc so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of one Attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account either newly created or existing in any part of the world which you will provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 75% for me and 20% for you. Then 5% will be used to offset any expenses incurred during the entire processing. Please your percentage is not negotiable. it is considerate enough. There is no risk at all as the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney, and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.  If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email address below. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. I am awaiting your urgent reply via my email: .femi-martin876@fsmail.net  However, after your initial response by email, I would suggest that you contact me via phone 234 8055467101, for a verbal and detailed explanation of this transaction .This is imperative, because I would like to speak with you in order to be sure of who I would be with carrying out this transaction with.

Now, in the continuing economic    downturn,  foreign  workers  are  being  blamed  for  displacing their    homegrown counterparts.     Wednesday,  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., will introduce a bill crafted    to  close  loopholes  in  employment  visa  laws,  which he says allow    companies  to  hire  foreign  employees  and  outsource  them to other    companies.     ADVERTISEMENT     IFRAME:    http://ad.doubleclick.net/adi/eweek.dart/news;sz=336x280;ord=456641793    3?    [news;abr=!ie;sz=336x280;ord=4566417933?]      [ew_spacer.gif]     ""We must make sure that our immigration policies don't have a backlash    effect  on displacing American workers,"" Chambliss said Tuesday. ""[The    bill]  will  end the practice of companies who are displacing American    workers.""     The  Senate  Judiciary  Committee  Tuesday  took a look at the role of    temporary work visas in the current economy. The technology industry's    use  of  H-1B  visas  dropped approximately 75 percent last year, with    initial  H-1B visa applications falling to 26,659 in 2002 from 105,692    in  2001,  according  to the Department of Homeland Security Office of    Immigration Security.     Despite  the  statistics,  as unemployment rises in the United States,    lawmakers are hearing from their constituents.     ""I  cannot  tell  you  how  many  workers  came up to me [in August in    California]  and  said, 'I've been replaced by somebody I trained, and    they're  getting  a  third  [the  salary] of what I got,'"" Sen. Dianne    Feinstein,  D-Calif.,  said  at  a  hearing  of  the  Senate Judiciary    Committee  Tuesday. ""Wherever I go, this program comes up and somebody    tells me they've been replaced, and they are angry.""     Intel  Corp.,  which  employs close to 80,000 workers worldwide, hires    individuals  through  the  H1-B  visa program when a position requires    unique  or  difficult-to-find  skills,  Patrick Duffy, human resources    attorney  at Intel, told lawmakers. Beginning in 2001, Intel decreased    hiring  overall,  but  it  continues  to  hire H-1B applicants when it    cannot  find  qualified  U.S.  workers,  Duffy  said.  The company has    particular difficulty hiring U.S. citizens for positions in electrical    engineering design and chemical engineering, he said.     Duffy  contended  that  the  H-1B  visa program does not displace U.S.    workers  and  ultimately  benefits  the  U.S.  economy.  Most  of  the    company's  H-1B visa employees studied at U.S. universities and earned    masters degrees and doctorates.     ""These are not temporary workers to us. The H-1B visa is just one step    in  making these workers U.S. workers,"" Duffy said. ""Hopefully they'll    stay with Intel ... the rest of their lives.""     Large  corporations  that  rely  on skilled foreign workers are urging    Congress  not  to pass short-term fixes that will later cause problems    when  the  economy  recovers.  In  the  boom  times  of the late '90s,    Ingersoll-Rand  Corp. had to take people off the payroll when the H-1B    hiring  cap  was  lowered,  Elizabeth Dickson, adviser for Immigration    Services  at  Ingersoll-Rand  in  Woodcliff Lake, N.J., told lawmakers    Tuesday.     ""When  the [foreign worker hiring] cap reverts to 65,000, we are going    to  have a lot of problems that we experienced both in 1997 and 1998,""    Dickson  said.  ""If  we  have a recovering economy, what are our needs    going to be long term?""     The  root of the problem, according to the industry officials, is that    Americans  earn too few graduate degrees in the hard sciences, leaving    the  domestic  pool of adequate engineering specializations too small.    Contrary  to some assertions, industry officials said they do not hire    foreign  workers  to  pay  them  less  than  they would pay Americans.    Dickson  told  lawmakers  that  it  is  more expensive to hire foreign    workers.     ""We  are  mostly  looking  to  hire U.S. workers. They're cheaper, and    there  are  a  lot  less problems,"" Dickson said. ""In the near term we    simply must have access to foreign nationals. If we want to maintain a    global edge, we want to have the best and the brightest working for us    in the United States.""     American  engineers  argue  that corporate America's use of H-1B visas    exacerbates the problem of engineering unemployment. Abuse of the visa    program,  in  particular,  leaves  qualified  Americans  out  of work,    according  to  John  Steadman,  president-elect  of  the  IEEE-USA  in    Washington, D.C.     ""If  we  continue  down  this path, the United States is making itself    increasingly  dependent  of foreign technical expertise, both here and    abroad,""  Steadman  told  lawmakers,  urging the government to support    programs  that  encourage  more  students--especially  minorities  and    women--to go into the sciences.",0

I agree with some of the above, but it's also true that there is no  requirement on anyone to respond to any particular posting, and you are  likely to get more responses if you do identify yourself.  If you don't,  there's always the possibility that you are a student asking us to do  your homework for you, or that you really should hire someone to do your  programming. My response may have seemed rude, but I thought at the time that it  would have been more rude to ignore the question completely.  In my  judgment the original answer was sufficient, and the followups showed  that Mr./Ms. Anonymous wasn't willing to put a reasonable effort into  solving the problem her/himself.

legitimate,phishing,True,"[Ip-health] USA for Innovation letter to Congress http://www.usaforinnovation.org/news/050907_USAFI_Adelman%20Letter.pdf  Ambassador Kenneth L. Adelman, Executive Director USA For Innovation P.O. Box 57052 Washington, DC 20037-7052  May 9, 2007  Members of Congress United States of America  Dear Member of Congress:  I wish to bring to your immediate attention the recent attacks on American intellectual property being perpetrated by Brazil and Thailand. These attacks endanger the basis of American prosperity, innovation, and jobs. Unless vigorous measures are taken soon, such attacks are likely to spread to other countries, to the further detriment of U.S. national interests.  Last Friday, Brazils President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva issued a ""compulsory license"" to override the U.S. patent on an AIDS drug made by Merck. Obviously, this measure undercuts future research and development on medical innovation, upon which the health of millions around the world depend.  The public rationale given by the governments of Thailand and Brazil to override the property rights of foreign firms is invalid. Issuing a compulsory license in this manner is considered by USA for Innovation to be illegitimate under World Trade Organization rules, indisputably bad policy, and dangerous precedent.  When Brazil and Thailand issue compulsory licenses, they signal to the world their unwillingness to respect international patent protection. If this grows into more of a trend  which it will, unless strongly resisted -- innovators will no longer choose to provide life-saving drugs and other medicines in these countries.  Moreover, such a move is short-sighted for the countries themselves. It hurts local firms in Brazil and Thailand trying to attract foreign investment. It hurts their patients, who will no longer have access to patented medicines which, in many cases, are the only treatments proven safe and effective.  Thailand and Brazil have no excuse for their behavior. They are not poor countries, and cannot claim to be in crisis. Thailands GDP ranks it among the top 10% wealthiest countries in the world, and its government spends little on health care. The World Health Organization notes that Thailand spends far less on health care (3.3% of GDP) than peers such as Argentina (8.9%) or poorer countries like Cambodia (10.9%) or Lebanon (10.2%). The United States spends 15.2%.  What is true in Thailand is even truer of Brazil. It is not only in the top 10% of richest countries in the world, but in the top 5%. While Brazil spends a greater percentage of its GDP on health (7.6%) than Thailand, it is still half of what America spends.  In attacking intellectual property rights of American and European companies, Brazil and Thailand threaten innovation, which is the lifeblood of our economy. In this age of globalization, U.S. intellectual property is our comparative advantage.  A 2005 study by two leading economists  the Democratic, Clinton-appointee Dr. Robert Shapiro and Republican advisor Dr. Kevin Hassett -- estimates that U.S. intellectual property is worth between $5 trillion and $5.5 trillion. This equals approximately 45% of the U.S. GDP, and is greater than the GDP of any other nation in the world.  Intellectual property accounts for about one-quarter of all business investment over the last decade. Intangibles now account for nearly two-thirds of the market value of large U.S. public companies.  As importantly, nearly 3 million American jobs depend on continued investment in biopharmaceuticals. The world benefits from the life-saving results produced by these American scientists, researchers, doctors and teachers. More than 70% of all world medicines are created by Americans. International refusal to pay for these products not only threatens millions of American jobs, it endangers our ability to produce the new medical treatments the ailing around the world need most desperately.  Both Brazil and Thailand enjoy extraordinary benefits from Americans. While American workers face expensive tariffs when exporting goods and services to these countries (including, incredibly, taxes and tariffs on medical products), both Brazil and Thailand receive generous treatment when sending their products to the U.S. under the Generalized System of Preferences.  Both countries also receive a host of military, humanitarian and other forms of assistance from the U.S. government, in addition to private donations from millions of American charities. It seems appropriate to remind leaders of these countries that the United States will protect innovation-producing American firms and jobs. Doing so now, in a vigorous manner, will save lives in these countries and throughout the world.  Sincerely yours,  Kenneth L.

I understand that argument, but I do think it requires a leap of logic (or at least some creative interpretation) to get from the DFSG to this position. While I can see why some people do not want CDDL-licensed software in main for the above reason, I do not think it is fair to call it the Debian position that this is the case; at least not yet.  Counter-arguments: * The bit ""(except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides   otherwise)"" means you don't necessarily have to give up all your   rights. There are parts of copyright law in most jurisdictions that   give unalienable rights to users; those fall under the above   provision, by definition. The net result of your first clause   therefore may be, depending on circumstances, that users actually get   _more_ rights than what they started out with if that provision wasn't   there, because their own copyright law doesn't give them nearly as   much rights as the copyright law in the country where the software was   written would. * Your second quote is a non-issue. The same is true for GPL-licensed   software; if not, then why did we have to consult two lawyers back   when we moved crypto to main? And why do we still have such insane   procedures today when some crypto-using software gets through NEW?   (you don't see them because ftp-masters handle them, but they're still   there).  Additionally, personally I don't think it's unreasonable for people to say ""if you use my software in a way that I didn't want you to, I'll sue you in a court that works by a set of rules that I'm actually comfortable with"". You know, it makes fighting those who do not follow your license the way you intended them to quite a bit easier.  --  Shaw's Principle: 	Build a system that even a fool can use, and only a fool will 	want to use it.   --  To UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-legal-REQUEST@lists.debian.org with a subject of ""unsubscribe"".

This is not so much ""clear"" as ""completely different"", but yes, that is the principle meaning of the word ""materials"" and the ony logical reason why the author would've used the term here.  A court is going to consider what the apparent intent was -- not try to stretch the meaning beyond the obvious.  > Would you expect an art *materials* catalogue to...  Hereafter, you are trying to stretch the meaning to something that it obviously wasn't intended to mean.  You can do that, because the license is POORLY WRITTEN. Which I have already said. Miraculously, you and I appear to AGREE on that point.  One consequence of this is that some lawyer might try to play the same games with the language that you are doing here.  I think the court would laugh in his face, but who knows?  > I'm trying to understand how it is possible to claim that compilers > don't fit the meaning of materials there  That would be by using the *normal*, *first* definition of ""materials"" and not some alternate meaning that has come about by association.  There is also the point that it wouldn't make any sense to require the meaning you are attempting to press: is there even a compiler which can be ""released in source format under conditions of this license""? If not, then it stands to reason that the author, knowing this, cannot have intended to limit compilation to such a hypothetical compiler. This is yet more evidence for an intent which agrees with the obvious interpretation of the language.  So, are you saying you honestly believe the author's intent was to block compilation of changes to his package altogether? If so, why distribute source at all? Furthermore, you believe that having this irrational intent, he then tried to hide it by using a word which *might* be interpreted to support his intent, but whose most obvious meaning contradicts it?  I find that a pretty implausible theory.  Your interpretation is distorts the license's original intent by using alternate meanings of words. As such it may even be semantically correct (that is, it may be within the set of possible semantic meanings of the utterance), but it is pragmatically incorrect (it is not the subset of that set that was meant by the author -- as we can tell from context). Intent is a matter of pragmatics[1] -- the study of situated utterances as evidence for meaning, not semantics[2] -- the study of isolated utterances for potential meaning.  You're pounding very hard on the semantics, trying to broaden the set of possible meanings, and you're not wrong about that as far as you go, but that's missing the point. The question was not ""what could this sentence possibly mean"", but ""what did this sentence mean when the author wrote it"" -- which is what actually matters legally.  The rest of the license, the fact of using the license, the fact of releasing software with source code and the consequences of licensing choices all provide situational information which supports the pragmatic interpretation of the sentence in question.  The fact that courts (or we) have to go beyond semantics to understand the license is a serious flaw of the license, which I've already pointed out, but as evidence of the author's actual intent, I think it is sufficient.

But former CIA Director George Tenet lets loose in our first story in a public venting rare for any public official, never mind a CIA director. Tenet angrily accuses the Bush administration of ruining his reputation by misusing his now-famous ""slam dunk"" remark about Iraqi WMD to justify its march to war. ""It's the most despicable thing that ever happened to me,"" Tenet says. ""You don't do this. You don't throw somebody overboard just because it's a deflection. Is that honorable? It's not honorable to me,"" he tells correspondent Scott Pelley.  He also reveals in this double-length segment his anguish and frustration over the 9/11 attack, the first of the president's inner circle to provide a glimpse inside it during what many would consider the country's darkest hour in modern times. You'll hear and see his feelings on the hunt for Osama bin Laden, the war on terror and its ""enhanced interrogation"" methods he says were not torture and saved lives. Pressed by Pelley to explain why, if it wasn't torture,  these individuals had to have their interrogations ""enhanced,"" Tenet, leans forward to respond, ""Because these are people who will never, ever, ever tell you a thing. These are people who know who's responsible for the next terrorist attack....[who] wouldn't blink an eyelash about killing you, your family, me and my family and everybody in this town.""          Watch  An Excerpt Of Pelley's Report.     With the questions still hovering over the massacre at Virginia Tech last week, correspondent Steve Kroft explores perhaps the biggest irony in the horrible event. It's the fact that Seung-Hui Cho, with a history of mental illness, was still able to purchase the guns he used to kill 32 innocent people, despite a 40-year-old federal law prohibiting the sale of guns to the mentally ill. Kroft reports that the law isn't enforced because many states have laws that protect the privacy of the mentally ill, advocates for whom still want their records sealed and not shared with other government agencies. Even the NRA won't go that far. The sad fact is that Cho wasn't the first mentally ill person to kill with a gun he purchased freely, nor will he be likely the last.     Watch  Kroft's Reporter's Notebook.     These stories and some interesting items from Andy Rooney's mail bag, this Sunday, April 29, on 60 Minutes at 7 p.m. ET/PT.

You have to make sure your locale is set to ja_JP.UTF-8  and you need to  make sure that kinput2 is working properly. This will involve having  kinput2 and cannaserver both running.  Here is more information:  http://dspnet.fr/~lonewolf/LinuxJapan/Howto_English_Japanese.html  Make sure that the XMODIFIERS environment variable is set such as this  XMODIFIERS=""@im=kinput2""  Then you can test input first using notepad.  run ~/cxoffice/bin/wine  notepad then try inputing Japanese into notepad.

Iraqi insurgents joined 10,000 U.S. troops in the offensive and took control of several areas north of Baghdad today. David Martin will have the latest.     And our chief foreign correspondent Lara Logan will update us on the orphanage story she reported on Monday. She'll give us some encouraging news about how the once-neglected Baghdad orphans are doing now.      Back in the United States, a South Carolina community is beginning the process of mourning nine firefighters who died in massive furniture factory blaze. Tonight, Kelly Cobiella will share the story of one man who escaped from the inferno.      And there's extraordinary new animation that shows more clearly than we've seen before why the World Trade Center towers collapsed on 9/11 after being hit by airplanes.     What if a Web site could tell you that going to one hospital in your area rather than another could dramatically improve your odds of survival? Now, one has been set up by the U.S. government. Wyatt Andrews will give you all the details.     Finally, it's been 35 years since the Watergate scandal drove former President Richard Nixon out of office. Now historians at the National Archives are poring over his speeches, gifts and recordings - yes, even that 18  minutes of blank tape - for installation at the Nixon Library. Richard Schlesinger will take us inside the vault for a fascinating history lesson.      Thanks and I hope you'll join us tonight,     ________________________________   Katie Couric CouricandCo@cbs.com            Advertisement       ________________________________  To unsubscribe or change your subscription options, click here  .

Based on that I can make these guesses:   X-Spam-Score seems to be score *10, and truncated instead of rounded.  This accounts for how -6.6 can become -65.. (-6.58 will round to -6.6,  but multiply and truncate and you get -65)  X-Spam-Bar probably generates a series of - or + signs for each full  point of score in that direction. (similar to SA's _STARS(*)_ tag, but  with negative scores represented). It's a wild guess, but seems reasonable.",0

legitimate,phishing,True,"Why spam isn't going away soon    CNET | Security Center                March 3, 2008     View online | Manage newsletters | Unsubscribe | Send us feedback                Why spam isn't going away soon         Recently, Symantec said in its February 2008 State of Spam report that 78.5 percent of all e-mail is spam. They also said most of that is now coming from Europe. That's a change from previous reports that had suggested servers in North America were responsible. What the Symantec report doesn't explicitly state is that much of the European spam doesn't come from individuals sitting at their desk pumping out lists. Europe is one of the hotbeds for the Storm worm botnet, notorious for automatically co-opting its victims into spam relays. For example, with the release of a Valentine's Day theme-spam barrage in early February,  Jose Nazario of Arbor Networks estimated that Storm has grown by as much as 50 percent in new infections. More ominous, Nazario says ""the fact (Storm) is generating lots of money means that it's in (the creator's) interests to keep grooming it, keep growing it."" Worse Storm isn't the only big, bad botnet in town. Read more Security Bites podcast CNET Security Center Security Watch archive   Robert VamosiCNET.com       Latest forum discussions  What is...

Additional Horoscopes Aries:It's time to get off your tush and tend to some errands that you've been putting off. You'll do anything but do what you're supposed to do, won't you? Stop procrastinating and act like a responsible adult. Taurus:Mix up your humdrum routine so your day is slightly less boring. Go crazy and try a new iced coffee flavor or wear a funky color underwear, even if it's doubtful that anyone will ever see them. Gemini:Your flair for remembering weird facts will come in handy today. You'll bring up something totally random to divert attention away from yet another sticky situation that you've gotten yourself into. Cancer:You'll butt heads with someone today due to 'creative differences.' The difference is that one of you isn't creative, and that's you. Let someone else come up with the unique ideas since all of yours are lame. Leo:Technology is not your friend when it comes to communicating today. In fact, messages probably spread faster in the Stone Age than via your computer. Use your land line if you want to touch base with someone or choose to remain incommunicado. Virgo:You're at it again. Buying things on a whim just to make yourself feel less empty inside. Sorry babe, but even truckloads of material possessions are going to bring you out of the dumps. Libra:Just because you're in the mood to socialize doesn't mean that others will be receptive to your conversational advances. You've been blowing off people left and right. Why the heck should they bother with you? Scorpio:Keep your fingers crossed that someone comes to your defense today. If you don't, then you're going to have a lot of explaining to do, and for once you didn't even do anything wrong!  Sagittarius:Say a goal aloud today. If you put it out there, then you might have a slight chance of it coming to fruition. It won't magically happen, though. You have to put some work into it, ya lazy bum. Capricorn:Today isn't the day to ask for a raise, or for any money for that matter. Your boss doesn't think you deserve it and your friends are a bunch of moochers. Aquarius:Whether you realize it or not, it'll be obvious to everyone that you're dealing with some issues. Drop the act and let people know what's going on. They like you better when you're not a total fake. Pisces:It's time to get off the roller coaster and find a kiddie ride that you can handle. You'll find more balance in your life when you're twirling around in a tea cup than hanging upside down screaming.                            Astrology.com Special: Looking to evolve?

legitimate,phishing,True,"[sugar] Fwd: OLPC Nepal looking for Volunteers for this Summer ---------- Forwarded message ---------- From: Bryan Berry  Date: May 3, 2007 6:54 AM Subject: OLPC Nepal looking for Volunteers for this Summer To: devel@laptop.org, games@laptop.org, olpc-open@laptop.org   from: http://olpcnepal.blogspot.com/2007/05/were-looking-for-volunteers-for-this.html  As you may read in the previous Post "" An Amazing Educator,"" a fantastic educator has joined our group. We are looking to work with her very intensely this summer to implement many of her existing learning activities and add as many cool activities as we can. In the fall we plan to visit many, many schools to figure out how kids and teachers react to these materials.  Right now we have three full-time volunteer developers, all of them Nepali. We would love four (4) foreign volunteers to come work with us this summer in Kathmandu. We will pair each foreign volunteer with a Nepali intern. That should bring our content strike force to 11 people. That would really help us to advance OLPC in Nepal.  Requirements: We are looking for experienced programmers. Your age and # of university degrees are less important to us than your passion for software development. We seek individuals with significant software development experience on Linux, ideally in Python, PyGames, C, etc. You should have already run the OLPC image in an emulator.  You should expect to stay in Nepal for a minimum of 6 weeks. You can stay a maximum of 5 months due to Nepal's complex visa rules. If your application is selected, you can start as soon as you can get here.  Compensation: We are prepared to offer a generous salary package of $0 per month, reimburse you for a full 0% of your airplane ticket cost, and offer no health plan. We don't have any $ :) Our office, bandwidth, and computers have all been donated. We can offer comfortable lodging for a total of four volunteers. We can accept additional volunteers if they are willing to find and pay for their own accommodation.  We can offer you an opportunity to work w/ a very passionate team of engineers on one of the most exciting projects in the world. If you are interested please send an e-mail with your C.V. and a brief description of what you have done w/ OLPC so far to bryan at olpcnepal dot org  Unfortunately, summer is monsoon season so Nepal aweseome trekking isn't a good idea. Still, it's been a weird year weather-wise. We'll try to get you out for a trek near the end of the summer.  We'll take you running/hiking in the hills surrounding Kathmandu if you are so inclined and subject you to Ankur's bad jokes (and they are very bad).  The Work: You will work closely with our lead developers Shankar, Ankur, and Himali Kiran and our lead educator Christine Stone. You will help implement a series of activities based on PyGame and/or GCompris. That means writing a lot of Python, possibly some C, working with sound libraries, and more. If you have some exciting ideas for power management or mesh networking, we may find some time to work on them w/ you. However, you should expect to spend most of your time building Sugar activities, getting feedback from Christine, revising, showing to kids and teachers, repeat.  We will expect you to train the Nepali intern assigned to you. The intern will most likely be an undergraduate computer science student.  The development team will frequently interact with kids and teachers over the course of the summer.  We intend to recruit education volunteers at a later date. I'll save that for a future blog entry.  --  Bryan W.

I have heavy issues with HOTMAIL since they reject ANY legitim messages as SPAM without any reason.  All of my 50 Servers are worldwide and in different subnets.  It is nearly impossible that all 50 Servers have spamed HOTMAIL, since my servers accept only authenticated SMTP from clients.  I am not registered on ANY blacklists (except  which is a crap service billing innocent ISP's and peoples instead of spamers) but can not send to my customers unsing HOTMAIL adresses.  since  exist, I am looking for the FRENCH legal address and I will su them since in Europe, E-Mail is falling under the ""Post- & Telecommunication Law"", which mean, rejecting legitim messages is like, the French Post is rejection any Letters coming from the USA.  And another problem is, that because of HOTMAIL I have already lost money...   And you know, ISP-Business is hard!  > Do away with Yahoo.

As I have written in a previosly message:  Since I can not reach my customers using  I reject all messages from them and leafe a message to let them know WHY.  And yes, this bounces are working fine and going correctly back to the sending  account...  Now, my Cell-Phone is smoking from international calls and they do not understand WHY I can not send messages to them...  > A real one - that delivers and receives mail, like a mail server > should.  :-)  In some weeks I am offering (not free but cheap) E-Mail-Accounts for 1 Euro/month and 50 MByte Mailbox with 5 Aliases...

All our transport destinations are under our control. We need our gateway to know if the user exists before hand to reduce filter load. We make sure all of our customers for who we transport to their own server make sure their server let us know when asked and, if possible, restrict any SMTP but from us.

This is not so much ""clear"" as ""completely different"", but yes, that is the principle meaning of the word ""materials"" and the ony logical reason why the author would've used the term here.  A court is going to consider what the apparent intent was -- not try to stretch the meaning beyond the obvious.  > Would you expect an art *materials* catalogue to...  Hereafter, you are trying to stretch the meaning to something that it obviously wasn't intended to mean.  You can do that, because the license is POORLY WRITTEN. Which I have already said. Miraculously, you and I appear to AGREE on that point.  One consequence of this is that some lawyer might try to play the same games with the language that you are doing here.  I think the court would laugh in his face, but who knows?  > I'm trying to understand how it is possible to claim that compilers > don't fit the meaning of materials there  That would be by using the *normal*, *first* definition of ""materials"" and not some alternate meaning that has come about by association.  There is also the point that it wouldn't make any sense to require the meaning you are attempting to press: is there even a compiler which can be ""released in source format under conditions of this license""? If not, then it stands to reason that the author, knowing this, cannot have intended to limit compilation to such a hypothetical compiler. This is yet more evidence for an intent which agrees with the obvious interpretation of the language.  So, are you saying you honestly believe the author's intent was to block compilation of changes to his package altogether? If so, why distribute source at all? Furthermore, you believe that having this irrational intent, he then tried to hide it by using a word which *might* be interpreted to support his intent, but whose most obvious meaning contradicts it?  I find that a pretty implausible theory.  Your interpretation is distorts the license's original intent by using alternate meanings of words. As such it may even be semantically correct (that is, it may be within the set of possible semantic meanings of the utterance), but it is pragmatically incorrect (it is not the subset of that set that was meant by the author -- as we can tell from context). Intent is a matter of pragmatics[1] -- the study of situated utterances as evidence for meaning, not semantics[2] -- the study of isolated utterances for potential meaning.  You're pounding very hard on the semantics, trying to broaden the set of possible meanings, and you're not wrong about that as far as you go, but that's missing the point. The question was not ""what could this sentence possibly mean"", but ""what did this sentence mean when the author wrote it"" -- which is what actually matters legally.  The rest of the license, the fact of using the license, the fact of releasing software with source code and the consequences of licensing choices all provide situational information which supports the pragmatic interpretation of the sentence in question.  The fact that courts (or we) have to go beyond semantics to understand the license is a serious flaw of the license, which I've already pointed out, but as evidence of the author's actual intent, I think it is sufficient.

phishing,legitimate,True,"IN GOOD FAITH  Dear Friend,  Good day to you. I may have to trouble your sense of personal achievement and reward for an opportunity properly taken advantage of.  I am Mr. Michael Ramsey, a representative and attorney to Kenneth Lay, the former chairman & CEO, Enron Corp. Industry: Energy &Natural Resources Home, presently in jail and facing trial on charges of corruption and embezzlement of funds while in Power. He deposited ($21,000,000.00) with me when he was in power as the chairman.   I am contacting you because I want you to deal with the Finance house and claim the money on my behalf since I have declared that the Funds belong to my foreign business partner. You shall also be required to assist me in investment in your country. I hope to trust you as a God fearing person who will not sit on this money when you claim it, rather assist me properly, share in this percentage, 60% to me and 40% to you. When I receive your positive response I will give you viable information relating to this project i.e. the Finance institution where the money was deposited and the required documentation that will enable you lay claims to the funds, which is very important. What I need is for you to indicate your interest that you will assist us by receiving the money on my behalf in Europe. For this, you shall be considered to be the beneficiary to the funds. The project in brief, is that the funds with which we intend to carry out our proposed investments in your country, is presently in the custody of a bank in Europe. I do not want the government of my Country to know about the money because they will believe I got the money from the sales of Enron stock when he was the Chairman & C.E.O.of Enron   Once I have your details in full, the finance institution will contact you for Release of the funds to your account. As soon as payment is effected, and the amount mentioned above is successfully transferred into your account, I intend to use my own share in acquiring some estates abroad. For this too you shall also be the overseas manager of all our properties and you will be paid based on a certain percentage agreed on by both parties. I guarantee you that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Please get in touch with me urgently by E-mail:mr2001@faithmail.com. I am presently in LONDON.   Please, provide me the following: 1. Full Name 2. Your Telephone Number and Fax Number 3. Your Contact Address.   Best Regards.   Michael Ramsey.    ___________________________________________________________________________ Mail sent from WebMail service at PHP-Nuke Powered Site - http://www.keinVW.de",1

But former CIA Director George Tenet lets loose in our first story in a public venting rare for any public official, never mind a CIA director. Tenet angrily accuses the Bush administration of ruining his reputation by misusing his now-famous ""slam dunk"" remark about Iraqi WMD to justify its march to war. ""It's the most despicable thing that ever happened to me,"" Tenet says. ""You don't do this. You don't throw somebody overboard just because it's a deflection. Is that honorable? It's not honorable to me,"" he tells correspondent Scott Pelley.  He also reveals in this double-length segment his anguish and frustration over the 9/11 attack, the first of the president's inner circle to provide a glimpse inside it during what many would consider the country's darkest hour in modern times. You'll hear and see his feelings on the hunt for Osama bin Laden, the war on terror and its ""enhanced interrogation"" methods he says were not torture and saved lives. Pressed by Pelley to explain why, if it wasn't torture,  these individuals had to have their interrogations ""enhanced,"" Tenet, leans forward to respond, ""Because these are people who will never, ever, ever tell you a thing. These are people who know who's responsible for the next terrorist attack....[who] wouldn't blink an eyelash about killing you, your family, me and my family and everybody in this town.""          Watch  An Excerpt Of Pelley's Report.     With the questions still hovering over the massacre at Virginia Tech last week, correspondent Steve Kroft explores perhaps the biggest irony in the horrible event. It's the fact that Seung-Hui Cho, with a history of mental illness, was still able to purchase the guns he used to kill 32 innocent people, despite a 40-year-old federal law prohibiting the sale of guns to the mentally ill. Kroft reports that the law isn't enforced because many states have laws that protect the privacy of the mentally ill, advocates for whom still want their records sealed and not shared with other government agencies. Even the NRA won't go that far. The sad fact is that Cho wasn't the first mentally ill person to kill with a gun he purchased freely, nor will he be likely the last.     Watch  Kroft's Reporter's Notebook.     These stories and some interesting items from Andy Rooney's mail bag, this Sunday, April 29, on 60 Minutes at 7 p.m. ET/PT.

legitimate,phishing,True,"[Ip-health] WSJ: trade deal a small step for generics -- [ Picked text/plain from multipart/alternative ] In Trade Deal, a Shift on Generics  *Agreement Opens the Door To Cheaper Drugs Abroad,  Easing Some Patent Rules *  *By SARAH LUECK*  *Wall Street Journal, **May 17, 2007; Page A4*  WASHINGTON -- A new trade agreement between Congress and the White House contains provisions that open the door to more sales of generic drugs in developing countries. The plan, reversing earlier gains for American drug makers backed by President Bush, marks the first big setback for the pharmaceutical industry since Democrats claimed Capitol Hill.  For now, the provisions likely only affect pending trade deals with Peru, Panama and Colombia. But the plan also signals a broader shift as congressional leaders give greater weight in trade talks to providing cheaper medicines for the poor, even if it means denying the Republican-friendly drug industry some of the protection it says it needs.  The administration ""has permitted the weakening of intellectual-property protections in these agreements,"" said Billy Tauzin, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the drug industry's main trade group, in an interview. ""They were desperate to get continuing trade authority"" from Democrats in Congress, he said. ""The fact is, their leverage changed since November.""  The main focus of the bipartisan trade deal, announced last week, involves requiring U.S. trade partners to meet new standards for giving their workers labor rights and ensuring environmental protections. But the deal also allows developing countries more flexibility in dealing with U.S. drug makers than they would have had under earlier versions.  Specifically, the policy would ease requirements on developing-country regulators to prevent the sale of patent-infringing products. It also releases trading partners from a requirement to extend the time for patent protections as a form of compensation for delays in drug approvals.  Public-health advocacy groups have argued for years that U.S. trade policy under Mr. Bush often protected brand-name drug makers at the expense of poor countries in need of more-affordable treatments. Many of those groups said they weren't satisfied with last week's deal. Even with the changes, they say, the Peru and Panama deals advance many of the protections the drug industry wants -- just fewer than would have existed if the Bush administration had stuck with its earlier trade stance.  *""Compared to the many steps backward that have been taken since 2003, this is a bit of relief for people who want access to affordable medicines,"" said Ellen Shaffer, co-director of the Center for Policy Analysis on Trade and Health in San Francisco. ""Compared to an actual policy that would provide affordable medicines for people and fairly balance that with innovation, it is a small step forward.""*  Trade is just one of many fronts where the pharmaceutical industry faces a less friendly policy environment, after enjoying strong support during years of undivided Republican rule. Some Democrats want to rewrite the Medicare prescription-drug benefit to allow the government to negotiate lower prices with manufacturers. Some Democrats also want to legalize imports of cheaper medications from Canada and other countries. The Bush administration has maintained its support for the industry on those issues, and the Senate has blocked those policy changes.  But on exports, the administration last week changed course. For the last several years, U.S. trade officials and drug companies have worked to push new protections for drug makers in countries such as signers of the Central American Free Trade Agreement.  Companies say stronger safeguards for their patents and proprietary data are needed in many countries, to delay generic competition and make it worthwhile for the industry to continue to invest in research and development of new treatments.  Under the new American trade strategy, the biggest loss for the industry is a change that may shift more responsibility to drug makers for preventing the marketing of patent-infringing products.  Under recent trade agreements, the U.S. pressed countries to agree to ""linkage,"" which requires local drug regulators to make sure a generic product doesn't violate any patents before allowing it on the market. Public-health advocacy groups have said this puts makers of brand-name drugs at an advantage and burdens regulators. Drug companies support linkage because it prevents copies of their products from being sold during lengthy court battles. Without it, companies will have to be more vigilant. To take industry concerns into account, the new policy calls for countries to set up fast procedures for resolving patent disputes.  Another change in the new trade policy would weaken a common provision in past trade agreements: that local regulators ""shall"" compensate drug makers for delays in the process of approving their products, by awarding extra time to sell their products free from competition.  Some Democrats said this unfairly penalizes consumers in those countries for slow bureaucracies. A description of the changes to the Peru and Panama agreements says countries ""may"" extend a company's patent to make up for delays, suggesting more flexibility on what they are required to do to compensate drug makers.  Health-advocacy groups complain the new policy still preserves the data-exclusivity provision used to block generic competition. In many countries, including the U.S., makers of generic drugs can often win approval by proving their products are equivalent to the original drugs. In that process, regulators use test data submitted by makers of brand-name drugs. The data-exclusivity provision typically prevents such use of the data for five years, acting as an effective hurdle for generics. The new policy does, however, place more restrictions on the five-year data exclusivity than previously existed in the Panama and Peru agreements.  *Write to *Sarah Lueck at sarah.lueck@wsj.com1    *URL for this article: http://online.wsj.com/article/SB117936226237705632.html*    *Hyperlinks in this Article: (1) mailto:sarah.lueck@wsj.com  *   -- Ellen R.

To fully leverage this new class of multi-core hardware, software developers must change the way they create applications. By turning their focus to multi-threaded applications, developers will be able to take full advantage of multi-core devices and deliver software that meets the demands of the world. But this paradigm of multi-threaded software development adds a new wrinkle of complexity for those who care the utmost about software quality.    Click Here to View This Whitepaper               Improving .NET Application Performance and Reliability with Managed Database Data Connectivity                Many .NET applications fail to meet user requirements because they do not provide optimal access to underlying Oracle, Sybase, or DB2 databases. The root cause is often unmanaged ADO.NET data providers shipped by the database vendor or from Microsoft. In this paper, SQL Server MVP and SSWUG co-founder Stephen Wynkoop explores common misperceptions about data access technologies, describes the optimum architecture for ADO.NET data providers, and highlights key selection criteria for developers.

Michael's Minute:  Lindows.com Report Card  As summer arrives, many school children are coming home with their report cards.  I thought this would be a good time to see what kind of grades Lindows.com received for their first 9 months in operation..   To view the Timeline of Lindows.com's first 9 months in business, click here  .  Operating System:   As of last week, consumers can experience LindowsOS in one of two ways. One way is to buy a computer running LindowsOS from Walmart.com  , for as little as $299. This is a significant milestone for us, as we've partnered with our first builder (Microtel) and retailer (Walmart). These computers work great out of the box and are ideal for general purpose computing tasks.  For those who already have a computer and also wish to try LindowsOS, we offer the Insider program  . This gives people wanting early access to LindowsOS a chance to try out LindowsOS as it develops. Currently, Insiders report installation success about 80%  of the time on their PCs. Therefore we have some room to grow, consequently, this product is not yet for everyone.  Some may wonder how we can sell a computer at Walmart  when the program available directly from Lindows.com is billed as not completely ready. The difference is the Walmart   computers are certified, ensuring that all components  work elegantly with LindowsOS. That's much different than offering a software program that will work on any computer in the world - that's very difficult. It's the difference between making a single pair of shoes for a known foot size versus opening a shoe store with every style of shoe for every size foot. The first one is easy, the second one is a much bigger job. While the installer is fantastically easy and fast (the entire OS installs in under 5 minutes), we've got a lot more work to do to support a wider range of hardware, printers and other devices. Grade:  B   _____   Software:  Our goal to give people choice means giving them choice not just on their operating system, but access to all the programs they'll want to add to their computer to really make it work for them in their school, home or business. Click-N-Run   is the easiest way to load software onto a computer. For the first time a Linux based system has leapt ahead of Microsoft's operating systems in ease of use. With 1,000 plus programs already in the Click-N-Run Warehouse  , users can find quality software titles for just about any computing task and, with a single mouse-click download, install and run these programs. All these titles are included in the $99. This is a fantastic consumer experience and price point. Look for a lot more great software in the Warehouse in the future. Grade: A-   _____   Microsoft Windows Compatibility: We live in a Microsoft world, so there needs to be a bridge from the legacy world to the broadband LindowsOS world. This means we need to support some bridge programs, file types and network devices to help people interact with the legacy Microsoft world. LindowsOS computers come with software to view, print and copy popular Microsoft applications like: MS Word files, MS PowerPoint files and MS Excel documents. There's great Linux based alternatives and we'll guide people to those alternatives (they're better than most people realize). To edit Microsoft files, we'd highly recommend one of the office suites in our Warehouse such as OpenOffice  .  Many of these programs are of very high-quality and a great value since they're included in the Warehouse  . Sometimes there are no viable alternatives for those programs, so we're investing necessary resources to support some Microsoft Windows based programs. Stay tuned for more developments in this area. Our printer support is ok, but there's lots of room for more drivers. Connecting to MS Windows based file servers is still a challenge. We need to get better in the above areas.  Grade: B    _____   Communication: We've tried to be diligent in communicating where our company is going which is why there's typically a weekly Michael's Minute  . While our overall goal has not deviated - Bringing Choice To Your Computer - our implementation has become more focused as we listened to what our Insiders and potential customers have told us. (Keep sending me your comments.) We have been de-emphasizing running Microsoft Windows programs because many of you told us you detest spending hundreds of dollars on individual software programs, forced upgrades and activation codes. It's not just the operating system, but costly Microsoft programs you're wanting to avoid.  Consequently, we've been emphasizing Click-N-Run because it will change the way you think about software. Having a neatly categorized library   of 1,000+ software titles all for a flat annual fee at your digital fingertips is an entirely new way to think about paying for software. It's immediate, elegant and affordable. There are lots of mischaracterizations about Lindows.com swirling around - which happens when you have a small organization which can't address every question or publication. We'll do a better job of addressing these in the future. For now, I wrote up answers to the Top Myths about Lindows.com. Check them out by visiting: www.lindows.com/myths  Grade: B+   _____   Overall: B+ Michael Robertson Please visit support.lindows.com   to answer questions you may have about LindowsOS or Lindows.com. Bringing Choice to Your Computer!    LindowsOS is presently available on LindowsOS Certified Computers being offered from Lindows.com   Builder partners.  The General Release of LindowsOS (available now for download and preview to Lindows.com   Insider partners) will be made available later this year for those wishing to install and run LindowsOS on their existing computer hardware.  The General Release version will support a wider range of computer hardware and includes unique features such as a ""Friendly-Install"" alongside an existing MicrosoftR Windows operating system, a streamlined installation process which requires no computer knowledge, and the ability to run a select set of ""bridge"" Windows-compatible programs.

legitimate,phishing,True,"Hi everybody!I'm writing a web application in java (tomcat + jsp/servlets + database  access with postgreSQL).This will be released under the GPL and will eventually be useful as a  framework for other web applications.The application main focus is e-commerce, but not limited to that.I would like to use some form of cryptography to protect data on the  database, but I have some problem figuring out the right approach.Above all, how to store passwords and keys in a shared web server.A problem that I was unable to solve is how to store keys for  encryption/decryption. The api that I'm using is the jca (jdk1.4.x),  and the methods of saving generated keys in keystores fails always. I can serialize the object, and store in the database, but this is not  the most secure approach: this key is needed to decrypt data in the  database, but the database is accessible from the web application.  Assuming that I can find a good and secure place where to store the  database password, I can use a different database with different  user... Argh... to complex and doesn't really solve the problem.Where I can found good documentation about this topic?There is another approach that I would share with the list, something I  thought that can be of bit interest, but probabily wrong and insecure.  After all, I'm a real beginner in secure programming, and I'm here to  learn methods and technics.First of all, I need a secure way to keep database passwords secure, so  I have to keep them separate from the main server. The right approach  could be using a small java bean application that run as normal user  (not tomcat, so it is not shared with other web services or, worst, the  nobody user), that has no shell login, but has a default home directory  or a place where it can hold passwords and keys.The web application could then open an ssl connection (could be done in  the init method at server startup) to get database passwords. The small  bean could check via code signature/rmi/whatever else that the source  is the right one, and handle all the database connections, or give the  db connection/password to the main web application.In this way, we solve the problem of keeping the keys and passwords in  shared directories, and also, an attacker should get root/bean user  account to read data. This is not perfect, and works only if your  provider gives the opportunity to configure a separated java  application (that means, really, another server running in the  background).Any suggestions?Thank you, Mario Torre --  Please avoid sending me Word or PowerPoint attachments.

legitimate,phishing,True,"Cabot Wealth Advisiory 7/5/07 - TV, Intelligence and More July 5, 2007  Salem, Massachusetts  By Timothy Lutts  -----  There's Nothing On!  The SAT Measures What?  A Company With Predictive Decisioning Software  -----  My wife recently attended a conference in upstate New York and one night found herself back in her hotel room, turning to the television for entertainment.  Now, in our family, real-time network television is a rare event.    Thanks to Replay TV, a one-time competitor of TiVo in the DVR (digital video recorder) business, our favorite shows get recorded on a big hard disk and we watch them when we want, skipping the commercials as we go.  In fact, the only time we watch commercials is during the Super Bowl.  More often, we read.  In any event, there was my wife, in a New York state hotel room, ""forced"" to choose from a dreadful selection of real-time network TV offerings.  Of course she could have turned it off, but in that dull hotel room in that strange town, she was just searching for a little life, a little humor, a little intelligence.  What she got was bad TV, along with an onslaught of repetitive, often-insulting commercials.  So she called me, and somewhere along the way she asked, ""Why do people watch this garbage?  And why do the networks play the same commercials, sometimes several times during the same show?""  I couldn't give her an easy answer, but I did sympathize, and that's really what she wanted.  Soon after, I googled ""top ten TV shows,"" and here's what I found.  America's Got Talent Dateline NBC Deal or No Deal Law and Order N-C-I-S C-S-I Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader? Two and A Half Men So You Think You Can Dance? C-S-I Miami  I've never seen any of these, which goes to show you how out of touch I am.  But I do know (from reading) that four of them are crime dramas, two are talent searches, two are game shows, one is a sitcom and one is a news magazine that typically focuses on human-interest stories.  Reviewing this list, I'm reminded of the words of HL Mencken, who wrote, ""No one in this world, so far as I know, has ever lost money by underestimating the intelligence of the great masses of the plain people.""  Then, a few days ago one of my editors commented to me, no doubt after viewing one of the those headlines like ""Man Shoots Self in Groin While Attempting To Make Ham Sandwich,"" ""You know, half of Americans are of below average intelligence.""  Upon reflection, it's obvious.  And it's statistically inevitable.    The average is near the middle, so half will always be below the average (technically, below the median, but given the very large numbers we're dealing with, there's little difference.)  And if you don't know the difference between mean and median, you probably haven't crammed for an SAT test lately.  The converse, however, does not mean that if you do know the difference you have crammed for the test recently.  That's logic at work.  And the SAT, now that I've brought it up, is not what it used to be.  In 1901 it debuted as the Scholastic Achievement Test, supposedly measuring what students had learned.  In 1941, the name was changed to Scholastic Aptitude Test, supposedly measuring what students were capable of learning, if they had the proper socio-economic advantages.  In 1990, that was changed to Scholastic Assessment Test, supposedly measuring . . . something scholastic?  And in 1994 the name was changed to SAT (the letters officially standing for nothing at all!)  Finally (or, should I say, most recently, because I suspect there are more changes around the corner), in 2005 the name was changed to SAT Reasoning Test, creating a potential redundancy of the word ""Test"" but only if the first T still stood for Test, which it doesn't.  Reasoning, of course, includes logic, and I like that a lot. I hope they keep that name for a while.  Now, I took the SAT a few decades back.  Two of my kids have taken it and the third is likely to in a couple years.  But something else has changed over the decades besides the name.  In 1995 the yardstick for scoring was adjusted to account for the growing number of kids from less rigorous schools taking the test.  The reason?  The big bulge in the middle of the distribution curve, which had previously been centered at 400, had slipped down into the mid-300s.  To get the mid-point back up, the average verbal score was artificially increased by some 70 points while the average math score had 20-30 points added.  The kids at the top and bottom were barely affected, but the masses of average kids near the middle saw their scores bumped up dramatically.  What does it matter?  Well, a good score helps you get into college.    But is there a correlation between success on the SAT and success in college?  Looking further out, is there correlation between success on the SAT and success in life?  The simple answer is, some, but not a lot.  And more and more colleges are recognizing that; the number of colleges that admit students without regard to test scores now exceeds 400.  But the SAT lives on, and will continue to be here for years to come.  Why?  In part because it's the product of The College Board.    The College Board is a non-profit organization, and while there's no doubt that it works hard to serve the high schools and colleges and families that use it, there's even less doubt - in my mind - that the organization works even harder to ensure its own survival.   ----- ADVERTISEMENT -----  Join Cabot Stock of The Month and get in on the next stock that explodes like these...   * Broadvision-up 670%  * Intuitive Surgical-up 500%  * Yahoo-up 317%  * Amazon.com-up 1,290%  * First Marblehead-up 50%  * International Game Technology-up 110%  * eResearch Technology-up 180%  * NetEase-up 100%  * Expedia-up 114%  * Broadcom-up 97%  * Netflix-up 173%  * Psychiatric Solutions-up 85%  * PetroKazakhstan-up 86%  * Nautilus-up 109%  That's the beauty of Cabot Stock of the Month.

""A financial services firm in Japan has begun offering lower mortgage interest rates to ""intelligent"" customers.  GE Consumer Finance Company is giving discounts to people who have good English or computer skills, and work in ""high-value"" areas such as the law.  The company says more highly skilled workers usually find it easier than others to get jobs and to keep them. They are therefore less likely to become insolvent and default on their home loan.  GE Consumer Finance Company claims this is the first time that mortgage rates have been calculated like this in Japan.  People who have high scores on a test of English proficiency and officially certified IT skills can apply for a small discount.  Those of them who also have certain jobs - such as lawyers, accountants, doctors and financial experts - can obtain further discounts.  If a couple are both employed in the 20 ""high-value"" professions listed by the company, they will be entitled to a major rate reduction.""  It makes sense, and I'm guessing it's illegal to discriminate that way in the U.S.  -----  Getting back to TV, the problem is not just the quality of programming but the quantity of time people spend viewing.  The TV is on for over 7 hours in the average American home, and the average American watches over 4 hours of TV per day.  Worse still, the average American child watches 1,023 hours of TV a year and spends 900 hours in school.  And one thing they're seeing in those hours is commercials.  For broadcast TV, commercials pay the bills, and the advertisers are doing all they can to ensure that the message from those commercials reaches your brain.  But more and more these days, people are working to avoid those commercials by fast-forwarding through them using DVRs.  So NBC recently tested people to see if those commercials had any impact at high-speed.  NBC, you know, wants its advertisers' money even if viewers are watching at fast speeds.  The result, according to a story three days ago in The New York Times, ""judging from the biological reactions, the test subjects were just as engaged while watching fast-forwarded advertisements as they were while viewing opening scenes from the NBC show ""Heroes"" at regular speed.""  When it comes to fast-forward advertisements, ""the assumption has always been that they have no economic value, that they have no communication value,"" said Alan Wurtzel, president for research at NBC Universal. ""But the fact of the matter is we're learning that they are valuable.""  And they're so ""valuable"" to the financial health of the TV industry that the commercial-skipping DVR that I bought years ago can no longer be bought!  But the problem is not just the commercials.  The problem is that every minute spent watching TV is a minute not being used to reflect, to do something productive, or to interact with other family members.  And the result of all this TV viewing, according to a recent study by the Culture and Media Institute, is that ""increased exposure to television correlates with a decline in acceptance of personal responsibility.""  Now, it's important to note that the word correlate was used there.    Officially, there's no established causality.  But my sense is that our country has seen a marked decrease in a sense of personal responsibility; that too many people all too easily blame others for their troubles.  And when personal responsibility shrinks, we get a culture that thinks it's okay to act stupid because somebody else will pick up the tab.  ----- Contest -----  Now, there is an investment idea coming here, but first I want to give a reward to a loyal reader who has chosen to read this far.

Do it now.  -----  And now, finally, here we are at today's stock.  It's about intelligence and it's about marketing, and if you understand how important marketing is to the world, you may like this one enough to invest in it.  You know and I know that at every turn, companies are doing their darndest to sell us things.  At Amazon they know what I've bought before and thus know what to sell me next.  And at Netflix they know what movies I've rated highly so they can suggest other movies they think I'd enjoy.  Those two firms have developed specialized software that serves their individual needs, but for most companies, there's off-the-shelf software that works very well, and a lot of it is coming from a company named Chordiant.  Here's what we wrote in a recent issue of Cabot Top Ten Report.  ""Chordiant (CHRD) makes customer service and marketing software that helps big companies deal with their customers, so that the goals of both the merchant and the customer are met. Customers include 21st Century Insurance, Bank of Ireland, Banque Populaire, Barclays, Capital One, Covad Communications, Cox Communications, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Lloyds, MetLife, Nokia, Prudential, Royal Bank of Scotland, Royal Dutch Shell, Time Warner Cable, T-Mobile, UPS and Wachovia. These are huge blue-chip companies, yet Chordiant is still a small company, and growing fast. Historically, the company has had trouble making a profit (its last profitable year was 2004), but after the first quarter's terrific results, CEO Steven R. Springsteel commented that solid profitability was ""due to the strong performance in our international business, the acceleration of percentage of completion project implementations in Europe, and greater enablement of our partners resulting in fewer Chordiant resources being required on some project implementations."" It sounds good to us. Since then the company has been awarded a patent for ""advanced predictive decisioning technology."" In other words, the companies using this software sometimes know what you're going to buy before you do! As companies come to depend on this software, Chordiant's future is likely to be consistently profitable, and the realization of that is why the stock is strong today.""  Digging deeper, I see that Chordiant has been growing revenues since 2003, and in the latest quarter saw revenues grow 25% from the year before to $32.8 million, while earnings jumped from a penny per share to $0.18 per share.  Analysts are projecting a profit of $0.48 per share this year and $0.72 per share next year.  And the after-tax profit margin was a fat 19.6%.  Trading at 16, it's rather low-priced and thus carries the extra risk of volatility that comes from stocks at this level.   But average trading volume is nearly 500,000 shares per day, and institutional interest is growing.  I'd like it better on a dip to 15, but if it doesn't dip there in the week ahead, 16 may be the best price you'll get.  -----  Editor's note:  To get regular updates on Chordiant, and to get first notice of other hot stocks, consider a no-risk trial subscription to Cabot Top Ten Report.
